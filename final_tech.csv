It took 1 year, but we finally cracked how to engineer  pique polo shirts and t-shirts  that make it easier than ever to dress stylish without compromising on comfort.   The outside repels stains, while the inside is anti-bacterial and odour repellent.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ              Pique is an amazing fabric. The pique polo was invented in the thirties by French tennis champion RenÃÂÃÂ© Lacoste, and it is one of  the most breathable and luxurious fabric constructions .  Through extensive research and prototyping we have created a unique treatment mix called  FreshCoreÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ . By manipulating cotton fibers we shield them from both bacteria and liquids. Our treatments do not affect the hand feel of the fabric and we are able to reach  the same level of breathability  than any untreated cotton polo in the market.ÃÂÃÂ    Learn more about our technology    HERE  .                     Repels all water-based stains, including red wine, beetroot juice, and coffee.         Odour and sweat repellent ,  keeping you fresh all day and beyond.              Choose from grey, light blue, white and navy.               Don't take our word for it. We use the unfiltered platform Trustpilot for all reviews - both the good and the bad. We have no way to interfere with the reviews. This is a part of our commitment to full transparency in both production, sustainability and customer experience.  Click   HERE   to read more reviews.            More than 120 media have told our story and tested our products. We have also been the runner-up finalists at the Dutch Innovation Awards and Get in The Ring, where we competed with startups from over 100 countries.ÃÂÃÂ                    Not all heroes wear capes. Some wear lab coats. And we work with the best of them in Switzerland and Portugal. LABFRESH is helping these creators get their smart inventions out of the lab and into closets across the globe.  When we develop a new product we put our back into it. We obsess. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why we only launched 2 products in 2 years.ÃÂÃÂ         By reducing the need for washing we extend the life-time of our products.  By investing in longevity, durability and wearability we contribute to lowering consumerism.  Wash less. Wear more. Buy less.ÃÂÃÂ    We keep a close eye on our environmental footprint and as a company we take full responsibility. This includes ensuring the best work environment at our manufacturer in Portugal.ÃÂÃÂ   At LABFRESH we work from a technology-based vision and non-seasonal approach towards building a collection that embraces longevity and essentials.  Read more about   REACH   ,    OEKO-TEX   and   Bluesign   .ÃÂÃÂ    Learn more about our approach to sustainability   HERE   .             Our story began 2 years ago on this platform, when we launched the odour and stain repellent shirt. ÃÂÃÂ   We got 1000% funded and immediately quit our jobs, so we could turn LABFRESH into a real business. ÃÂÃÂ   Without Kickstarter we wouldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t be here today.ÃÂÃÂ   Launching new products is scary. It requires a lot of resources to get new technologies out of the lab and into a real supply chain.ÃÂÃÂ   That is why we would like to see if the Kickstarter community is interested in our new invention, before we go into full-scale production. ÃÂÃÂ   Our mission hasnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t changed. We want to fight fast fashion and over-consumption by creating products engineered to last a lifetime. Wear more. Wash less. Buy less. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ                                                                                Unlimited cancellation.  You are able to cancel your order at any point in time and get a full refund (until the day the product is shipped).ÃÂÃÂ    90 days size guarantee.  If your size is wrong we send you a new product in the right size, free of charge (we do not provide free return labels).  If your size is wrong we send you a new product in the right size, free of charge. We offer free exchange shipping for the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Belgium and France.   Free and easy shipping across the EU, US &amp; Canada.  Shipping costs to other parts of the world is only ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬15.ÃÂÃÂ    Stain repellency   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ We guarantee that our polos and t-shirts will repel stains that are caused by water-based fluids and semi-fluids. If stains are caused by oil-based fluids, such as skin oils or greasy food, the product will need to be washed or cleaned with stain remover.  We test the stain repellency for 30 washes at 30 degrees with ironing after each wash and no tumble-drying or bleaching. A lot depends on the type of machine, washing program, and detergent used, which is why we are not comfortable extending the guarantee above 30 washes for the stain repellency. Since the products need significantly less washing than a traditional cotton product 30 washes will give you a lot of wears.   Odour repellency   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ We guarantee that our polos and t-shirts will repel odour caused by bacteria, such as odour from sweat. Our shirts will not repel odour from cigarettes or cooking. Due to the many different variations and levels of perspiration we unfortunately cannot guarantee a specific amount of days the products will last before odour starts being absorbed into the fabric. We know that our current customers wear it 3,5 days. But we guarantee that the anti-bacterial treatment will be active for at least 100 washes.   Shrinkage   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ We pre-wash all garments and guarantee that shrinkage will be maximum 1%.ÃÂÃÂ    Sweat stains   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Our products block moderate amounts of sweat, but if we made it 100% hydrophobic the sweat would stay on the body and hence not be comfortable in a warm or humid environment. What we can promise is that LABFRESH products block perspiration better than a traditional shirt, and it dry up faster. ÃÂÃÂ    Lifespan technology   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ We guarantee that the stain repellency will last for 30 washes and the odour repellency for 100 washes.  Keep in mind that you have to wash LABFRESH shirts less, so itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s still a lot of wears.                            Risks and challenges  LABFRESH is fashion, not sportswear. You might be able to run a marathon in it without smelling, but that is not what our products are intended for.  With regards to stains we have been able to wash off any liquids and semi-liquids with water. However if you rub a substance into the fabric with force or if a very oily sauce comes in contact with the fabric, it will eventually make a slightly visible stain. You'll have to put it in the washer at 30 degrees to get the stain off.  Technology: It took as a full year to optimize our Pique fabric. The main explanation is that Pique fabric differs from our standard jersey t-shirt as it has a textured, waffle weave look whereas jersey (normal t-shirts) have a smooth, flat surface. This is particularly nice for a knit pique since its super breathable and can easily be worn in warm summer months. However this also means that a Pique fabric literally has tiny holes. We canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t work magic on a fabric, so holes will be holes, which means bigger spills might make your body a little bit wet (without staining the fabric). Besides this the pique fabric is as stain repellant as any other product we make.  Production delays and unforeseen obstacles are always a risk. This is however not our first rodeo. We have made more than 20,000 t-shirts with our manufacturer and we are confident they will produce the pique fabric on time as well."

While there are a variety of reasons for campaigns failing to deliver their products, we believe it comes down to the following reasons: 1. Manufacturing Experience 2. Honesty &amp; Transparency 3. Crowdfunding Project Execution  1.	Manufacturing Experience ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> Our team has over 10+ years of experience working with electronics, remote control vehicle and drone manufacturers. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve developed deep relationships with our manufacturing partners and we know what their capabilities and strengths are. There are established product development processes and procedures that we have refined and perfected together over many years. Also our experience in supply chain and logistics means that our backers will enjoy efficient and smooth shipping and delivery.  Many failed crowdfunding campaigns donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t start actually developing their product until after the campaign is over. We believe that to be an unwise decision that usually leads to unexpected challenges, delays and eventual failure. At Bolt Drones, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve actually completed all the design and development work upfront. Our designers and engineers have already done all the foundational work and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re now just tweaking and perfecting the product. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve gone through numerous prototypes and are almost ready for our first large production run.  2.	Honesty &amp; Transparency ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> Many failed drone campaigns embellished and oversold the capabilities of their product. They also werenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t honest with their backers and were slow to respond to their questions and concerns. We believe in the opposite. We believe in accurately describing the capabilities of our drone and being clear and upfront with all our backers. We arenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t promising a self-flying, autonomous, teleporting, auto tracking turbo super fantasy drone. We are realistic and have developed an innovative and versatile first person view drone at a radical price.  3.	Crowdfunding Project Execution ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> A successful crowdfunding campaign is not easy to execute. Planning and preparing to launch a campaign is only a small part of the equation. Once a successful campaign is completed, there is still a ton of work to complete: finalizing product development, beginning mass production, customer engagement, logistics, shipping, delivery and many other small but important steps. Members of our team have successfully completed other Kickstarter projects in the past. Backers of these projects received their rewards on time and as described. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve done everything possible to minimize the risk to backers. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve been through the entire Kickstarter project cycle before and are confident we will deliver.  We want to restore the Kickstarter communityÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s faith in drone projects and hope you will join us on this journey!  Kickstarter Superbackers ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> You are valued and important members of the Kickstarter crowdfunding community. We plan to organize a few events where you will get a chance to fly an advanced prototype of the Bolt drone and give us feedback.

We need your help to make a course that teaches coders soft skills. 'Soft skills' include networking, communication and management skills.ÃÂÃÂ   If you want to start your own coding business, there much more to it than the technical aspects of the job. We want to teach coders how to stand out in the tech industry and successfully start their own business.ÃÂÃÂ   Even if you donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t want to make your own company, this course will teach you skills that will make you invaluable wherever you work. ÃÂÃÂ   Marketing yourself as a coder is a strategic career plan. Learning to code is becoming as important as learning to read. The world economy has a growing software industry.ÃÂÃÂ You donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t need to buy expensive machinery or an office building to create the next blockbuster app or software tool.ÃÂÃÂ   Learning to code is not enough to start your own coding business. There is much more to it than the technical aspects of the job.   There is a gap in the skill set coders enter the marketplace with. Many coders lack of soft skills. That's why weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re making a course to help the Steve Wozniaks of the world be a little more like Steve Jobs.        ÃÂÃÂ   True, a large part of what you do as a coder is technical. But to be successful, you need to do just as much interacting with clients, other coders and stakeholders.  With the right soft skills, you can easily understand what a client wants. You can communicate your own needs and solve problems such as inter-team conflict.        1.	We have a unique approach.        We based this course on proven psychological methods and on our experience in the coding industry.ÃÂÃÂ WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve narrowed down the specific skills you need to keep your business running.ÃÂÃÂ   Other soft skills courses donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t cater to the unique challenges of coding. We do.  At the end of each section, you will know how to apply soft skills to your work. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re committed to updating the course in response to input from you. We want to create dynamic solutions and share knowledge with the whole student community.ÃÂÃÂ   2. We've got fascinating topics.  WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve developed a curriculum of the best skills to complement a coding business.ÃÂÃÂ 6 key areas can strengthen the core of your coding business:ÃÂÃÂ    The psychology of entrepreneurship  Fusing soft skills and software development  The code of human interaction  The art of persuasion  Expanding creativity  Mastering team dynamics   Too many courses that involve psychology are obsessed with theory. Our course will give you practical advice that will make you more effective at running a business.  3. We will support you.  The teachers behind this course are known for their dedicated student support. We offer 365-days-a-year support. (Yes, even on Christmas!)  This means that if you need help with something, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll get help within a few hours depending on your time zone.  We are committed to listening to student feedback and using that information to update the course and make it better.

Hi Kickstarter, my name is Dovid and IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m the Head of Product Development at East Brooklyn Labs.ÃÂÃÂ   Like most people today, I have multiple electronic devices I use daily. Between my cell phone, smart watch, AirPods and iPad, I have a lot of charging I need to do every evening. Add to that my wife and my kids' devices, and you can imagine the amount of messy wires I have lying around all over my home.  The world is moving toward wireless technology, but weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re still using individual charging docks for each of our devices. I decided to change that. To create the only one charging dock youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll ever need - for every one of your different devices.  It took us two years of research, product design, development and manufacturing, but we finally came up with iQonAir: The worldÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s first all-in-one universal wireless charging device.ÃÂÃÂ   You can keep the iQonAir on your bedside table, your office desk, coffee table, or anywhere you regularly keep your chargers, and easily charge all your devices without any messy wires.ÃÂÃÂ   With your help weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll finally say goodbye to the constant search for a phone charger. With your help weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll finally say goodbye to always running out of wall sockets. And with your help weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll finally say goodbye to the pain of tangled wires.ÃÂÃÂ   With your help, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll say hello to iQonAir.ÃÂÃÂ        Back in 2017, we sat down with a team of product designers and electrical engineers to brainstorm for the iQonAir. ÃÂÃÂ   We knew 3 things about the product we wanted to create:   It would have to charge multiple devices at once.    It would have to be lightweight and compact.    It would have to become the only item anyone ever needed on their bedside table.ÃÂÃÂ    Now it was time to figure out how.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ            Risks and challenges  We look forward to this project being a great success and filling a giant need for the everyday consumer. Like any project, though, there are challenges which we hope to overcome."

The funds will go into creating an aesthetic website to support our main agenda of showcasing and modernising African fashion through leveraging on technology. We will also use the funds to hire our own models, meet with Designers and effectively market our product throughout the African continent and beyond.  The African fashion industry is a market with a lot of potential and creative people. It is estimated to be worth $31 billion. The main reason why it is still untapped is due to the fact that there is lack of centralised discovery platforms that allow for the various stakeholders in the fashion industry to meet.  To address this problem, we came up with Zendea. Zendea is a platform that helps designers meet with their potential clients through online showcasing of their work. The aim is to simplify the idea of fashion exhibitions into a website which strives to give the same experience. We believe the website needs to look aesthetically pleasing, elegant and genuinely African. In addition, unique features will also be included in the website, in order to attract and retain our websiteÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s users.  I recently worked in one of the worldÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s best high-end department stores, which is located in London. Many brands were on display in the department store including Gucci, Chanel but I couldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t find any African-inspired clothing. Furthermore, when I travelled to South Africa and Kenya, I realised that very few city dwellers wore African fashion. My projectÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s mission is to make African fashion designers and fashion lines, have a greater domestic and international appeal.      Risks and challenges  My Co-founder(Philip Ombasa) and I, plan to consult with Lawyers, to make sure our website operates responsibly.   Most Founders of young and exciting companies tend to have unrealistic expectation but my Co-founder and I, have access to and will utilise the professional support of our former university's Multi-disciplinary Business Incubator.   With regards to marketing, we will use flyers, Word-of-mouth marketing, social media and other relevant forms of advertising.   We will ensure that our website is secure and functional by investing in a good web hosting platform.  As long as we secure our funding goal, we will be able to fulfil all of our rewards promises. We are committed to turning this idea into reality and keeping our promises. If unforeseeable circumstances occur, we will adapt and effectively overcome them."

Very easy to install.  Millions of liters of water are wasted every day. At home, in companies, in manufacturing, and, of course, at ablution. The recommended amount of water per ablution is 0.6 liters. It is impossible to comply with this recommendation with a regular faucet. Mostly, about 2 to 2.5 liters of water are used per ablution. It does not have to be that way. With WuDuSimple, you will only use 0.3 liters per ablution. Overall, that is a large amount of water that could be used in different ways around the world. In Mecca alone, ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦ liters of water could be saved every day.    How WuDusimple works:          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

More informations at out Website:  www.wudusimple.com                Story     About Andy &amp; Hampash   Since the waste of water during the washing of the prayer has always been a thorn in our side, we have been asking myself for some time how we can save more water during the wash and other activities.   In the beginning, we had no plan how to implement something.  Who can help us with this? How to do it? When we both met and came back to the company in March 2018, where we got to know each other, we talked about ideas at every opportunity.  In May we had came up with the idea of WuDuSimple.  When we came up with this idea, we were fascinated. After that we asked ourselfes... how to realize our idea? How to turn a design into a finished product? How does marketing work? What companies there are that support you? what mindset you need to have in order to realize an idea? So here we after more than a year. Now the time has come and we have a finished product: WuDuSimple.ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  Before launching WuDusimple on Kickstarter, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve made multiple prototypes.

How:   After decades of experience working in the automotive and racing industry we understand how dangerous chemicals related to keeping your cars on the road are. In developing a high-performance product for racing, we found a way to make some of those chemicals safe.ÃÂÃÂ      If we only knew then what we know now ! Bradley Miller, developer of SAFE Antifreeze  Circa 87' shown working the Month of May @ Indy500 Developer of the 1st Digital Fuel Injection Systems used in IndyCar &amp; Formula 1 Racing &amp; many other safety related products in Motorsports     SAFE Antifreeze  is the safest, most environmentally friendly antifreeze ever developed.

If it has a liquid-cooled engine, it can use our SAFE Antifreeze.  Secondary: Marine and industrial liquid-cooled engines and equipment.  Volume: Ethylene Glycol (EG) is used in a variety of end segment applications.  How much new antifreeze is produced each year? Worldwide, well over 400+ million gallons of antifreeze concentrate are sold each year.  After the typical 50% dilution with water, this yields about 800+ million gallons of engine coolant. Between 25 and 50% of this volume ends up improperly in the environment, and dumping by consumers is a major cause of this pollution.  Approximately 90+% of the remainder is mixed with wastewater, treated, then discarded to surface waters.  Since Ethylene Glycol is a petrochemical product, its price rises along with natural gas and crude oil prices.  Governments like Australia are imposing more regulations concerning antifreeze management in Mining operations but this is a slow process so SAFE Antifreeze wants to lead the way in making these products more accessibleÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+008B> &amp; affordable globally.  Consumers are expecting more regarding responsible resource stewardship that is where SAFE Antifreeze comes in.  Proper cooling system maintenance and removal of Ethylene Glycol based Antifreeze can mitigate the harmful effects of antifreeze on our environment.  What is the difference between ethylene glycol and propylene glycol? Ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are chemically similar but extremely different in toxicity. Ethylene glycol has the chemical formula C2H6O2. Propylene has the chemical formula C3H8O2. Ethylene glycol has a slightly higher boiling point than Propylene Glycol. Ethylene glycol is much less expensive to produce and is more widely used. Propylene Glycol is GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) by the FDA non-toxic.  Pricing: SAFE Antifreeze | Coolant vs Competitors  Our competition is going to come from a comparison of a traditional poison Ethylene Glycol (EG) product being a few dollars less because it's always on-sale since 1927.   Other Propylene Glycol (PG) 50/50 Based Antifreeze | Coolants we have found to contain Silicates over 250+ppm plus other toxic inhibitors such as Nitrites so we don't see these today as our competitors.  Our competitors are large marketers of the dangerous products we want to replace and they will have their less toxic entries but the reality is their incomes are made from the other hazardous products they haven't stopped producing. Please help us to change the marketplace.   Time to Market: 2-3 Weeks from Kickstarter releasing funds if we reach our goal.

Another year and another 30 giga tonnes of CO2 will be emitted into our atmosphere which needs to be taken back out, this device will allow nature to do her job and turn CO2 into wood and oxygen.ÃÂÃÂ   Climate change doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t need to be tied up in politics and targets, but rather be empowered by a series of small shifts that together will make a big difference.  I invented a device that harnesses the reaction force of any rotating body, turning it into useable energy. This device can be fitted to almost anything that spins, from automobiles to power stations, improving energy production and/or efficiency without fundamentally changing any other process, making it fast and relatively cheap to execute and hence, most importantly, attractive for industry and governments to want to implement. Stage one of a four stage plan has been completed, a small scale test was conducted to support the principle using a 0.75kW motor, and now I need your help to move forward.  Stage two requires production of detailed CAD drawings and simulation utilising powerful computers and professional software which will be used to engineer stage three ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> the development and manufacture of a precision engineered working prototype. To secure the resources needed for stage two I need to raise $35,000.  Stage 3 can't be properly costed without the drawings for CNC machines, gears, other machined pieces, web site development, patents and sundries but it would be in the region of $100,000. Stage 3 would be concluded by the end of December 2019, with regular updates on how it is proceeding throughout the year if the funds are raised.ÃÂÃÂ   Stage 4 is to get approval to establish the Gayle F McKeachnie and Donal E Kolb research wind farm in Vernal, Utah, USA. The Vernal region will become our ground zero for the global fight on climate change. The wind farm could become a tourist attraction that will live in history forever as the starting point where we began to wrestle back our home from this atmospheric fire. Our plan will supply enough clean renewable energy for 18,400 homes and be carbon neutral in about 6 months. The turbines would be retro fitted with the device and 4mW generators but using the same body, hub and blades of the 2mW generators. This would turn 11 x 2mW (total 22mW) into a 44mW farm proving the energy infrastructure we have can be converted to produce more electricity. I have sourced 11 surplus wind turbines which could possibly be purchased for $12,000,000, with the entire project cost of about $22,000,000.ÃÂÃÂ      Surplus Wind Turbines to be utilised    My device will benefit the entire planet, with every ecosystem and living organism being given a reprieve. We need to stop waiting around for our governments to get beyond policy talks and multi-nationals with political and financial games to play. It is time to take action, help me get this project to the next stage whilst there is still time and together we can make a difference.  If the device were to be installed immediately on all nuclear, hydro, wind, wave, pumped water and geothermal generating power stations worldwide around 6 giga tonnes of CO2 would be saved from entering the atmosphere each year as most of the coal, oil and gas power stations could be taken off the power grid.  If I can leave you with one last thought, ""If we have met then it is through these words"".  ""I have learned to use the word impossible with the greatest of caution"" - Wernher von BraunÃÂÃÂ   ""To see the future, you have to create the future"" - Brett Elliott      Risks and challenges  The principle has been proven with a crudely manufactured device and I firmly believe the main risk and challenges will come from Governments and multi-national businesses. This is where a ground swell of support from the average person must come to lift climate change above politics and profits. This couldn't have been imagined only a few years ago, lobbyists and politicians would have just turned a blind eye and shelved it. Remember that there is a presidential election soon."

I found the need to reach out to a broader audience, and audience that is more global and connected than ever before.  Online teaching courses with a backend on AI (Artificial Inteliigence) as a business is not only thriving nowadays, but it is the future. The online courses will be mostly related to the technology field, from developing user experience (UX) methodologies to User Interface (UI) programming and AI coding, our courses will be concise and practical so students can put to work and shared what they had learned. My team is bilingual and so we are planning to launch this courses in English and Spanish language.  I have a team of 4 people with an educational background experience and skills who are eager to jump on board this endervour. As mentioned our online programs are based in three categories, all of them related to technology:   1.) Ai (Artificial Inteligence) courses on: ME (Machine Learning) and DE (Deep Learning) - basics, principales, evolution and advance.  2.) UX (User Experience) development and design courses in areas such as, but not limited to: concept and design principles, UX processes, UX prototypes, and UX execution and deployment.  3.) UI (User Interface) development and design courses in areas such as, but not limited to: design principles and practices, design essentials, and design software tools.   I had experience in the traditional educational field, and I know how difficult it is sometimes to have the time and resources to fulfill this goal, there is no doubt it is difficult but not impossible. It is important to teach and share knowledge in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, not only because it is the future but the present. There is so much information out there about the infinite possibilites in areas such as AI, and so teaching these courses will really create an impact on people's mind on how important it is to acquiere knowledge in this field.  I had acquired through the years the trust of many tech firms that will allow me and my team to embark in this journey. It is through my partnership with them that I pledge to share this knowledge to audiences everwhere so students or proffesionals can think about how these concepts will influence their everyday life.  Our plan is to start with free 15 minute videos where we talk about the importance of these technologies and how students or proffesionals can take these courses for free once they have another person sign up as well. The idea is for students and proffesionasl to share their experience with their friends or colleages in order to create a fan base and traffic to our site. We are in the process of creating a site and social media channels where we are going to provide as much information possible.  In order to start this project we need a solid financial base where I can incentive my four collegaes to venture in this long term proyect. Through the online courses we are not only going to raise money to keep this project alive but to keep the momentum where other people want to jump on board.ÃÂÃÂ   Our main obstacles is competition, but our main difference will be to give students or proffesional access to up-to date articles or information in our site that will keep them interested in our courses. What we want to offer everyone is practical business case studies where they can how practial and important are these topics, and the growing market that will impract all levels of society.  Our main goal is to incentive users to share knowledge and be the channel (through our site) where people can share knowledge and the latest trend related to the development of ÃÂÃÂ AI and subsequet fields.  Lastly I want to thank you for reading this staement and I really do hope you support us in this crazy adventure...it is by being crazy that we believe we can change this world.      Risks and challenges  Risks might be that some people will not be able to connect since they don't have internet, but I will open a Youtube channel where they can see a summary and shared with more people."

And if you feel the same, then TReGo is fot you!  Our trolley upgrades your bike unlike anything you have seen  and adds a unique transportation dimension to your ride!         Fun meets Functionality   TReGo is a trolley, made to carry heavy things anywhere you go. But what makes it unique is that it's the first trolley that turns YOUR bike into a practical cargo bike in seconds.       It's that simple: no tools needed, no permanent modifications to your bike and never get your hands dirty, thanks to our  patented FAST-connector .  ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        TReGo is a true door-to-door solution! It's a practical way to transport heavy loads or bring groceries home on your bike.        ÃÂÃÂ AND use it as a standalone trolley to take it with you where your bike can not go.        Not limited to the front of the bike, TReGo can also be used with our towing cart kit. Connect it to the rear axle and tow it behind you for long travels and bulky, heavier loads.       ÃÂÃÂ        Once TReGo is attached to your bike, your new riding experience begins. The two tilting wheels make turning corners a blast.   ÃÂÃÂ We've made sure you'll enjoy your ride, whether you're in a rush...       ÃÂÃÂ   or have time to play around...       Check out TReGo in the skate-park  here .       ÃÂÃÂ    The FAST-Connector   It's never been easier to upgrade your ride. The innovation of TReGo is our FAST-Connector. Our patented connecting system allows you to  connect &amp; disconnect the trolley to just about any adult bike. No greasy hands, no tools needed and no permanent modifications to your bike neither.         Once attached to the fork the FAST-Connector has three functions:    1.  Enables you to connect &amp; disconnect  the TReGo trolley in seconds. Connect to just about any adult bike (26"" or bigger)   2.  Functions as a bike stand . The bike stands firmly when the trolley is not connected and the fork is protected from any damage  3.  Enhances Bike security . When the trolley is disconnected, no one will be able to drive off with your bike. The FAST-Connector is securely locked to the fork of your bike. A special screwdriver is provided so only you can take it off when necessary  ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Don't buy another bike, just utilize the bike you already have, upgrade it and start carrying. TReGo has the benefits of traditional Cargo Bikes, but offers the following key advantages. TReGo       is smaller, easier to store   is multi-functional  adds theft security   is fun to ride   costs lessÃÂÃÂ         TReGo is compact in size and is easy to store.       Folds easily into a compact size (telescope handle bars)   Small enough to be stored at home   Even when fully loaded, your bike dimensions don't change much         ÃÂÃÂ        TReGo has undergone extensive test rides on different terrains. We set the highest safety standards for ourselves and guarantee TReGo will live up to them. Our trolley will be certified in the US and the European Union and abide by all safety standards.   Disc Brakes   We have equipped TReGo with  two hydraulic disc brakes , one on each wheel. The brakes are part of the trolley and can be controlled by a separate brake lever.        The hydraulic brakes provide high braking power when connected to the bike for safely controlling a fully loaded trolley       Just move the brake lever from the trolley to the handlebar, using our adapters and you're ready to go. The brake lever also includes a locking button that locks TReGo's wheels whenever you are parked.  ÃÂÃÂ        In choosing manufacturers it was important for us to know that our partner breaths and lives bicycles. We have therefore partnered with professional bicycle manufacturers who  master the technology and understand the engineering which will guarantee the highest quality.       The TReGo Trolley  TReGo is equipped with an aluminum rack (made in Canada). The big loading surface is the base to carry your heavy loads.       ÃÂÃÂ   Carry up to 25 kg/ 40 lbs on the rack and enjoy a new transportation dimension on your bike.ÃÂÃÂ    We will offer the rack in different colors.  Up-Cycled TReGo Bag  We have designed a special bag for our trolley. It fits right onto the rack and is big enough to fit 40 L/ 10 Gallons.        The bag is made of  up-cycled materials  and will be produced in the US by  ECOLOGICDESIGNS , Colorado. Using up-cycled materials will ensure that every bag will end up with a unique design, no two bags will look alike.   The bag can also be used without TReGo, thanks to the added shoulder strap.   Bag Features:         Size: 20x33x80 cm / 8x13x30 in   Volume: 40 liters/ 10 gallons   Materials: reclaimed billboards   Adjustable size shoulder strap   Velcro closure for weather resistanceÃÂÃÂ    Reflective light patches for nighttime visibility   Made in the USA   Towing Cart Kit      TReGo is truly multi functional and is not limited to being connected to the front of your bike. We developed a special aluminum box that attaches to the trolley. The cart easy hooks up to the rear wheel of the bicycle.   This allows you to transport heavier loads up toÃÂÃÂ 40 kg / 88 lbs on different terrains with greater ease and comfort.        ÃÂÃÂ    Towing Cart Features:        Box size: 74x42x10 cm / 29x16.5x4 in   Load capacity: 40 kg / 88 lbs   Material: Powder coated Aluminum  Made in CANADA  We will offer the box in different colors   COLOR OPTIONS:  TReGo's Rack and Box come in five different colors:ÃÂÃÂ  red, blue, white, gray and black.

Over the last couple of years I was involved in several medical and experimental exoskeleton projects and taught a variety of exoskeleton classes and labs.During this time it became clear that many students get very excited about robotic exoskeleton technology once they hear about it, but often there is no possibility for them to get involved and learn about it. To change that, we launched the EduExo project.",1.0,2016-01-31 02:11:13 -0500,Backed 0 projects,"Zurich, Switzerland",8,"The EduExo  The EduExo is a robotic exoskeleton kit that you assemble and program yourself. It contains the hardware that you need to build an elbow exoskeleton. An accompanying handbook contains a tutorial that will guide you through the different assembly steps. In addition, the handbook provides background information on exoskeleton history, functionality and technology. In the end, you will have a good understanding about exoskeleton technology and its application, together with hands-on experience building and programming your own robotic exoskeleton.      The EduExo kit contains all parts that you need to assemble an elbow exoskeleton and a handbook with a tutorial.    The EduExo hardware combines off-the-shelf components (motor, force sensor and Arduino microcontroller) with a rigid exoskeleton structure and cuff interfaces.        Quick Facts:    What it is:        It is an educational robotics kit that will help you to learn about exoskeleton technology.   It is a do-it-yourself kit that requires your active participation and willingness to learn and try new things.    For whom it is:        For high school and college students who want to learn about robotic exoskeleton technology to prepare themselves for a career in exoskeletons and wearable robotics.   For makers and hobbyists who are looking for an interesting and entertaining project in a fascinating field.   For teachers and professors who want to set up exoskeleton courses or labs. The EduExo provides additional teaching material and can save a lot of time and money.   Project Background  When thinking of robotic exoskeletons, movies such as Iron Man, Aliens or Elysium may come to your mind. But already today there are many real world exoskeletons that support rehabilitation of stroke patients, enable people with paraplegia to walk again or assist workers lifting heavy objects.      Examples for existing exoskeletons. Left: a stationary arm rehabilitation exoskeleton e.g. for stroke therapy. Right: leg exoskeleton that enables users with paraplegia to walk. Pictures used with permission of ETH ZÃÂÃÂ¼rich, Switzerland.    And todays systems are just the beginning of a very promising and quickly growing field that is in need of many skilled talents within the next years.  Due to the novelty of the field, getting involved and learning about robotic exoskeletons is difficult as learning material or even exoskeleton course or classes are not widely available yet. This is made even more difficult as learning about exoskeletons is not possible by theory alone, but also requires practical hands on experience (you have to see and feel it to understand it). Unfortunately, the necessary exoskeleton hardware is expensive and there are no dedicated and affordable learning devices available. This is what we intend to change with the EduExo.  The EduExo recently won the Wearable Robotics Association Innovation Competition in April 2017.         ÃÂÃÂ    This prize was awarded to us by a jury of CEOs and CTOs of leading exoskeleton companies, highlighting their demand for exoskeleton talents. Click on the banner above to learn more.

"" - All3DP   What You Will Learn  By going through the tutorial, you will learn how the mechanical design resembles the human anatomy, how to connect the sensors and the electronics board, and how to design and program a control system. Further, you will  connect the exoskeleton to a computer and learn how to use it as a haptic device in combination with virtual reality. Each chapter of the tutorial introduces one topic, starting with the necessary theoretical background, followed by a set of exercises that the user implements with the hardware.     Excerpt from the Handbook. Each chapter introduces one topic, starting with the theoretical background followed by a set of excercises.    The following topics are covered:ÃÂÃÂ    Exoskeleton Introduction   The first chapter will introduce you to the field of robotic exoskeletons and to exoskeletontechnology. What are robotic exoskeletons? What are they used for? How do they work? Since when are they being developed and used? The introduction will get you started and inspired.        Mechanics and Anatomy ÃÂÃÂ   This chapter covers the basics of human functional anatomy and exoskeleton mechanics: How does the human create forces and is able to move? How does the exoskeleton provide support? How is the exoskeleton designed to match the form of the human and how is it attached? During this tutorial, you assemble and wear the exoskeleton.        Electronics and Software ÃÂÃÂ   The next chapter covers the electronic and software components that convert the mechanical exoskeleton into a robotic exoskeleton. You will connect the electronic components, sensors and actuators to an Arduino microcontroller, and write the basic software routines to read sensor signals and control the motor.        Control Systems ÃÂÃÂ   The control system defines the behavior of the exoskeleton. After a general introduction into exoskeleton control, different controllers that define the exoskeleton-user interaction are introduced. Step-by-step we discuss, implement and test them.        Virtual Reality and Video Games ÃÂÃÂ   Video games and virtual reality simulations are well-established methods in use with medical exoskeletons. They are used to increase motivation in patients that use exoskeletons for rehabilitation, e.g. after a stroke, to keep them engaged even in therapy sessions that can last for hours. You will learn how to create a computer game, connect the exoskeleton to your computer (Windows PC) and use it as a game controller.

Measuring the user's muscle activity to estimate movement intentions is an interesting way to control a robotic exoskeleton and the EduExo will show you how it can be done.ÃÂÃÂ   The extension contains a muscle activity (electromyography-EMG) sensor, cables to connect it to the Arduino microcontroller and electrodes to connect to the user to get you started.

This way you can decide for yourself if you want to learn about this advanced robotic exoskeleton control approach or if you prefer to first get started with the basic kit. The extension will be offered separately after the full release of the kit.  Beyond the Tutorial  The EduExo tutorial introduces you to all you need to know for a deeper understanding of robotic exoskeletons. But, of course, there are many more possibilities of what you can do, and the EduExo is the perfect platform for your own experiments and ideas. Maybe you want to develop your own control algorithm or a new computer game that can be controlled with the EduExo? Or you want to learn more about mechanical design; you can start by designing new parts and interfaces to optimize the exoskeleton for your own arm anatomy. If you have implemented a great idea with the EduExo, we will be happy to share it on our website and YouTube channel.  Why we need your support  We have working prototypes of all components and have written many sections of the handbook. But we still have to finalize the hardware, finish handbook and tutorial, scale production and order the components. Therefore, we need your support. By contributing you will help us to create a STEM education kit to make robotic exoskeleton technology truly accessible. In return, you will be among the first to get the EduExo and gain knowledge and skills in a seminal field    Stretch Goals  We have reached 150% of our minimum funding goal (or 12k CHF)! Thank you so much for the support!  As we have more than two weeks to go, we added stretch goals in case the campaign gets even more support. Of course, the stretch goals will benefit all backers.       The Rewards       Project TimelineÃÂÃÂ    The EduExo project started as a side project (besides a PhD in robotic exoskeleton research) and has been in development from early 2016. But only with the beginning of this year we were able to commit more time to turn the prototypes into a product to offer the EduExo to interested users, schools and universities. With your support, we expect to finish the development within the next months and start shipping in August. When we fulfilled all Kickstarter rewards, the EduExo kit will be fully released.  Spread the Word  If you like our project, we would highly appreciate if you helped us spread the word and share this campaign through your social media channels. Our  Facebook  and  Twitter  username is @eduexokit.  What the EduExo is not  To make sure that your expectations match our intentions, here are the things that the EduExo is not:       It is not a medical device that is intended to be used for any kind of therapy or medical application.   It is not an exoskeleton that will make you super strong. The actuation is weak. It is only intended to illustrate basic exoskeleton principles while being affordable and safe. You will not be able to do more chin-ups. It rather provides a gentle guidance of your voluntary movements.   It is not a plug-and-play device that works out of the box. You have to make it work, that is a feature!   Requirements  The EduExo is designed for users that are new to robotic exoskeletons. Basic programming and electronics skills are benefitial, but you can learn everything you need while using the kit. The tutorial includes step by step explanations and sample solutions.  To use the EduExo some preparation is necessary. Most of the electronics can be connected without soldering and a breadboard  and jumper cables are included to get you started. The force sensor requires soldering to connect it. For that you need a soldering iron and some basic tools. Don't worry If you have not done this before. The equipment is not expensive and we include a step-by-step explanation in the tutorial. The Muscle Control extension also requires soldering. To program the exoskeleton (Arduino UNO microcontroller) you need to install the Arduino IDE. It is for free and can be downloaded on the Arduino website for several operation systems. For the ""virtual reality and video games"" chapter, you need to install the Unity 3D game engine. It is for free for private and non-commercial use but requires registration. So far we have only tested the Windows (7 and 10) version of it and cannot promise that the communication between exoskeleton and game works (similar) on other platforms.  Due to shipping regulations no battery is included. For all the tutorials we use the Arduino's power out to supply the sensors and the motor. While it is limited in power, it is sufficient for the tutorial. You can expand it later with a motor shield and even replace the actuator if you like. The Arduino itself has to be battery powered when wearing the exoskeleton (safety).  Shipping and Taxes  We are shipping the EduExo from Switzerland and ship worldwide. The shipping fees are listed with the rewards and will be added during checkout. You are responsible for any taxes, customs charges, etc. required by your country. We will attach the bill to the parcel and the product will be labeled as 'educational robotics kit' with its real value (what you paid for it). This should minimize any delay in case it gets processed by customs.      Risks and challenges  We use mostly off-the-shelf components that are widely available. But sometimes products change, are (for some time) not available and in stock or are discontinued. To minimize these risks we use parts which are interchangeable with little adaptation of the design.  In case we run into supply problems and have to adapt the design, it could delay manufacturing and shipping of the boxed kits. If you choose the maker edition (3D print it yourself), we will send you new STL files in case we update the design because of component supply problems."

I still can not believe a cure has not been found seeing howÃÂÃÂ it isÃÂÃÂ basicallyÃÂÃÂ the same as if we had a person immune to a virus but haven't found out what makes the person immune. I think it's because people are so set on thinking that it must be sound related. The simple fact that people who claim to experience relief during a shower also say they do not get that relief simply listening to shower sounds seems to indicate something else is going on.  Has anyone ever seen the movie Daredevil and specifically the rain scene where Daredevil can actually see by means of sonar? It is my belief that the sound waves that echo off during a shower create a sort of sonar that vibrates off the skull creating the effect. I'dÃÂÃÂ like to research the effects of sonar on tinnitus.  Funds raised thru this project will be used to purchase the necessary equipment to properly record the vibrations generated when water from a shower hits the flower and walls which I believe creates an echoing effect that vibrates off of a personsÃÂÃÂ head. It is these vibrations that I believe can be simulated with aÃÂÃÂ pulsating device that can be worn on a person's head. The funds will then be applied to find appropriate manufacturers to create the end product.ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  I'm a engineer by trade and have the incentive to fully research this possible solution as I have been suffering from bad tinnitus for over 6 years now.

All you have to do is apply the skills you learn in this course to your chosen challenges and problemsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦   ...or keep on crushing video games, thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s plenty of fun in itself!     HereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s some perspective...    The same team that built Alpha Go (the AI that beat the worldÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s best Go player...at the worldÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s most difficult game), built an AI that created an innovative way to control Google's cooling system in one of their data warehouses, saving the company  40% on their electricity bill.  Imagine  nearly halving some of the costs in your own business or home?    The point is the videogames are just training wheels, the world is your AIÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s real challenger.        Introduction Module:  Learn key AI concepts and intuition training to get you quickly up to speed with all things AI. Covering:   How to  start building AI  with no previous coding experience using Python  How to  merge AI with OpenAI Gym  to learn as effectively as possible  How to  optimize your AI  to reach its maximum potential in the real world         Module 1: Breakout  - Each module contains its own entire mini course, taking you from beginner to expert in each field. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll start simple in Module 1 and build up in difficulty.   Module 2: Doom  - Build more complex AI as you progress through the course. In module 2 we will be taking on the challenge of passing a level in the popular game Doom. Watch in amazement as your own AI improves itself in front of your eyes! (not for those who take pride in holding the highest score...).   Module 3: Self-driving cars simulation  In the final module, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll face your most exciting challenge yet ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> we will show you how to create an AI for self-driving cars! This will bring you even closer to the cutting-edge applications in use today and prepare you for deploying your AI in the real world.  Each module will contain enough high-quality material to stand alone as its  own  course, but with  Artificial Intelligence A-ZÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢  you will benefit from not 1 but  3 courses in a single package,  meaning you get extra practice with advanced knowledge and skill in time for this ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>New Industrial RevolutionÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ.       (Note: This is a mockup. Actual design may differ)ÃÂÃÂ        SPECIAL BONUS for Kickstarter backers ONLY. Not available anywhere else:   Bonus Module 4: Pacman  - Included with your Kickstarter pledge. Learn how to program your AI to conquer this era-defining arcade classic and benefit from even more practice developing cutting-edge AI.  ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s 33% extra course material!   And whatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s more ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> these examples will trigger your creative mind to spark unique ideas for your own intuitive solutions. Either in the physical world or in digital products such as high-potential apps, rather than copying a typical ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0098>recipe bookÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> course.       ÃÂÃÂ        Plus! We really want you to succeed in building AI and that's why we are going to add the following three Bonuses to any pledge level you choose (starting from Super Early Bird and above):    An AI cheat sheetÃÂÃÂ  to enhance your creations' learning abilities and potential   AI one-pager LaTeX  with relevant formulas for you to have handy whenever you need it   Bonus video  where weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll talk about the full power of AI and how itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s rapidly changing the world as we know it         1. Complete beginner to expert AI skills  ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> Learn to code self-improving AI for a range of purposes. In fact, we code together with you. Every tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.   2. Code templates ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093>  Plus, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll get downloadable Python code templates for every AI you build in the course. This makes building truly unique AI as simple as changing a few lines of code. If you unleash your imagination, the potential is unlimited.   3. Intuition Tutorials ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> ÃÂÃÂ Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way, we believe in developing a deep understanding for not only what youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re doing, but why youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re doing it. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why we donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t throw complex mathematics at you, but focus on building up your intuition in coding AI making for infinitely better results down the line.   4. Real-world solutions ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093>  YouÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll achieve your goal in not only 1 game but in 4 (incl. Bonus module). Each module is comprised of varying structures and difficulties, meaning youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be skilled enough to build AI adaptable to any environment in real life, rather than just passing a glorified memory ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>test and forgetÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ like most other courses. Practice truly does make perfect.   5. In-course support ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> ÃÂÃÂ WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re fully committed to making this the most accessible and results-driven AI course on the planet. This requires us to be there when you need our help. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve put together a team of professional Data Scientists to support you in your journey, meaning youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.        ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>What if I donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t have any need for AI right now?ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ   AI is rapidly expanding into our lives each and every day, meaning even though you may not have many uses now, soon youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll have hundreds. Picture this, those who first heard about the concept of ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>electricityÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ would have thought exactly the same, now look at the world. Same thing goes for tech ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> you would have been puzzled by the need for a ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>SmartphoneÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ ten years ago, yet now we canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t imagine our lives without one. The true potential only becomes apparent in time, do you want to risk missing out?   ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>I like that thereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s no complex maths, but this isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t TOO simple, right?ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ   Not at all. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll take you to the same level as if youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>d learned AI the long, hard way - we just choose to teach in ways that are a lot more fun (and less headache-inducing). By the end of this course youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be able to implement complex AI in your personal life, business or career and achieve amazing results.   ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen other courses charge for a certificate, is this course the same?ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ   We donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t believe in charging $300 just for a certificate of completion. If you pass this course you deserve the right to show your new skills by default - thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why our certificate of completion comes free for you to show to future employers, further your business credentials or simply to show off to friends.   ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve already done the Deep Learning course, will this course still benefit me?ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ   Deep Learning is a great asset when applied to very narrow problems, interpreting data points in niche business algorithms for example. However, these constraints mean it falls short when tackling a wider range of problems. Learning general AI opens up a whole host of new possibilities not just in narrow business solutions, but across entertainment, robotics, health, transportation, or anything you put your mind to!       ÃÂÃÂ        WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be on hand to support you along your  entire journey!         See what other students just like you are saying about our recent best-selling courses:ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Upon completion of this course youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll get a verifiable electronic certificate which you can use to boost business credentials, increase the chances of landing that dream job in tech or simply show off to your connections on Linkedin (the actual design will differ):       ÃÂÃÂ        We hope youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re as excited about this idea as we are. AI will be a huge part of all our lives so itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s only fair that you have an equal opportunity to get involved. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re passionate about bringing AI to the world, and today we need your help to ensure this groundbreaking course becomes a reality.

Some of the major ones include: sourcing the right equipment, learning to produce clear and engaging tutorials, finding what exactly interests our students, having the appropriate level of subject matter expertise.  Having built up a substantial level of expertise in the space of online education we are confident that we are well-equipped to face any challenges: we have tried and tested equipment including backup hardware and software; between the two of us we have already produced over 20 courses with hundreds of hours of content and almost a thousand tutorials enabling us to develop our unique engaging teaching styles; we constantly interact with our existing 150,000+ students including Q&amp;A, webinars and surveys - this allows us to know exactly what common painpoints we need to address in the course content; and finally, we do have extensive backgrounds in Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning but we are constantly doing research and deepening our own knowledge to make sure we can deliver the best of the best to our students in Artificial Intelligence A-ZÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢."

Up until now only businesses that had an eCommerce website could use an Affiliate Marketing Program. So, from a business standpoint anyone from retail to contractors can now utilize our app to allow them to have affiliates working for them to send them referrals and they do not have to pay out commissions until they are already paid and since they are affiliates they do not have to pay expensive employee costs or benefits. From an affiliate standpoint now they can work with their local small businesses and help them drive sales and build the local economy from the palm of their hand by sharing on social media, by word of mouth using their affiliate code or sending a direct message to the business with their referrals contact information all from within the app and when the referral makes a purchase the business will pay the affiliate through the payment options the affiliate chose when setting up their profile.

For one person, the thrill might come from the nostalgia of going bike riding as a kid, with a little more speed. We canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t tell you what exactly makes an e-bike so much fun, but this is why we ride: Between feeling the wind like youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re in a convertible with no doors, being able to weave through traffic ever so smoothly, or feeling the instantaneous acceleration when you hit the throttle, every time we ride is just as exhilarating.  Our goal is not to build just another e-bike. We have a passion for innovation, design, and performance. The never ending pursuit of it is what drives us. By donating to our campaign, you are not just helping us build cool bikes, you are helping us pursue our passion.    ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ         Wired  - ""Several companies are rethinking the e-bike aesthetic, drawing on some of the coolest motorcycles of the past to build something new yet retro. The latest comes from the Canadians at Tempus Electric Bikes.""   Designboom  - ""TempusÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> CR-T1 electric bike stands out because of its design that recalls the form of a 1960ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s cafe racer motorcycle. the result is a bike that boldly brings together the newest battery and motor technology with a stylish motif of the past, combining all the ease of riding a bicycle with the power and looks of a motorcycle.""   Treehugger  - ""If your desire is for old-school looks coupled with high-tech features and performance, then this e-bike certainly fits the bill with its cafÃÂÃÂ© racer lines and 1000W electric motor.""   Bike Rumor  - ""Seeking to combine the best elements of motorcycles and bikes, Tempus added todayÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s technology to a classic look to create their debut model, called the CR-T1.""   Inhabitat  - ""The founders of Tempus Electric Bikes started their business with one simple goal in mind: to build an e-bike with a truly unique and striking design, and theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve certainly succeeded with their first model.""ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ      50 km/h top speed    We use the highest quality 1000 Watt Brushless DC Hub motor, located in the hub of the rear wheel. Hub motors are the most reliable type of e-bike motor, because they only have one moving part. Having a hub motor in the rear wheel gives the CRT1 great motor efficiency and a low centre of gravity. This way, our bike can handle extremely well, while supplying a thrilling amount of power. When given full power, the 1000 Watt Hub Motor allows the bike to reach a top speed of 50km/h. You can use the thumb throttle, or pedal assist in order to power it.      48V 17Ah. 50 km range    Our 48V 17Ah (816 Watt-hour) removable battery located on the bikeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s downtube is powered by LG lithium Ion cells and, is 33% larger than the industry standard (545 Watt-hour. Think of this like the size of the gas tank; the higher the Watt-hour, the more range you have) and weighs only 9lbs. Additionally, the battery can be locked to the frame of the bike with a key, or can be removed which allows you to take the battery inside to charge. Our battery comes with a 4Ah charger, so you can fully charge the battery in 4-5 hours. It has a lifespan of over 600 cycles (30,000 Kilometers) and also includes a 5V USB port for charging any device on the go.       With a motorcycle seat and a tough ABS Controller Tank, we designed our bike to look, feel and ride like a vintage motorcycle. The controller tank doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t just look good, it protects the brains of the bike: the 30A Sin wave motor controller, the 12V power converter and the wiring used in our electrical system. Waterproof connectors and the controller tank keeps all of the electrical components safe, and adds to the aesthetic of the bike.       Each bike comes with a Full Color Display LCD that gives you Speed, Distance, Time, and Battery Percentage. With the LCD, you can set a 4 digit password, choose your pedal assist level, and customize many other ride stats. Additionally, the LCD is connected to the motor controller, which allows you to program other settings like motor power and speed. You can check your local e-bike laws and adjust the settings to make your CRT1 legal in any country. In most countries, e-bikes do not require insurance.       When youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re going as fast as 50 km/h, a reliable frame is crucial. To save on cost, most bike companies build with aluminum, which can fracture under extreme torque. We design and custom build each of our frames with Aircraft Grade Chromoly Steel, so you donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t have to worry about reliability. The CRT1 might make you feel like youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re flying but our frame will make sure that doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t actually happen.       Our bike includes bright integrated 12V head and rear LEDs that run off the main battery, so that you can see where youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re going and others can see you. Most e-bikes donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t have integrated lighting systems, which is dangerous and requires buying additional lights that you have to recharge separately. We hide our 12V power converter inside the controller tank to hide ugly wires and maintain a clean design.       ÃÂÃÂ These brakes are smooth as butter, and stop the bike on a dime. The 180mm Front and 160mm rear hydraulic disc brakes outperform mechanical disc brakes in both comfort, and stopping power.       We did something most e-bike companies do not: we added high quality dual crown locking front suspension forks. We wanted the CRT1 to be comfortable, and give the rider the option to take the bike off-road; the front suspension forks do just that. They absorb most of the shock and vibrations from bumps, which keeps you riding longer whether thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s on the road or off.       Soft, comfortable, and big enough to take a friend for a ride.

With the money raised, we plan to rigorously test suppliers and purchase the necessary tools and parts required to build the bikes.       Our goal is to continuously push the boundaries of design in the e-bike market. Regardless of the result of this campaign, we will continue to do that and move our company forward.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        In order to thank you for contributing to our campaign, we will be offering some awesome rewards.

There are many opportunities to use them everyday. Whether you use it to go for a coffee or to the gym, to get to work, exploring your area, or looking for exercise, an e-bike can fit in perfectly with your lifestyle. They do not require gas, licensing, or insurance. Our controller can limit motor power and speed so that everyone can ride legally and have the top speed available for off road fun. They are legally classified as e-bikes in most places, usually making it more efficient than a car or bus during rush hour. You can lock it anywhere you would lock a regular bicycle, making it exceptionally easy to park.       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Since July 2015, we have worked countless hours to bring our e-bike to market. We have built 4 prototypes of the CRT1, making huge improvements every iteration. Now, we can confidently say that we are ready for our first production run.       Our Story  5 years ago we built our first high speed electric bike and fell in love with the freedom, power and flexibility that e-bikes offer. Like many startups, Tempus was started in a garage. In the summer of 2015, we started the company and started our journey towards building bold electric bikes. A few months later, we wrote a full business plan, rendered 3D models, and began working on bringing our bike to market.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ      Co-founders Ikenna Ofoha (left) &amp; Xavier Chan (right)    ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help.

We have planned out everything we have to do to for it, and the associated risks. When backing a company in its early stages, there is always risk associated. The best that we can do to minimize our risk is plan for anything that could go wrong, and be ready for it. This way, we wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t be taken by surprise when we hit an obstacle. Some of the risks we have identified and are prepared for are:  Large-scale production: Until now, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve never brought a product to full-scale production. Luckily, our mentor has years of experience in developing and bringing products to market.  Supplier Testing: Our bikes are custom crafted with high quality components. Some of the parts we test however, will not be. We have planned out a rigorous testing method for our components to make sure that our suppliers are top-quality.   Shipping: If our shipping procedures are not sound, there could be huge delays for our backers. We have been working closely with shipping and customs brokers to make sure we know international shipping procedures and the associated costs."

Thanks to the support of the maker community, anyone can share their knowledge and learn from thousands of other projects. You can create anything using basic components like switches and LEDs, or more advance components like digital interfaces and wireless communication modules. The only limit is your imagination!  Makers around the world have asked themselves the same question: where do I find reliable and easy to use circuit diagrams for my projects? I've spent years tinkering and making stuff with Arduino, ARM mbed, ESP8266, etc. and one of the things that always annoyed was how difficult it was to find reliable, simple to read and aesthetically pleasing circuit diagrams, reference tables and pinouts.   Back in 2013 I began designing my own and making them available for free on my website  pighixxx.com . I have created so far more than 300 high quality circuit diagrams and pinouts that are used by more than 500,000 makers worldwide. The feedback from the community has been amazing and it has encouraged me to create more and more content. The only problem is that they're not very convenient to use on your computer screen where the programming environment should be the main open window. Also, printing the diagrams can only add more clutter to your desk.   We've been working hard for the past months to deliver a great product that will solve these problems.   ABC: Basic Connections        ABC: Basic Connections is a completely redesigned selection of the best circuit diagrams, reference tables and pinouts from  pighixxx.com , plus many new unreleased designs.   The book is a collection of neat, easy to read circuit diagrams and pinouts that will show you how to properly connect almost anything to your Arduino, ARM mbed or ESP8266 compatible boards. ABC: Basic Connections is great for both beginners and professionals and it can be used as a resource for teaching electronics.

The book will contain more than  100 high quality, 200gsm, coated, A5 (8.27x5.83 in) sheets inside a custom ring binder, with multi-color tab dividers . The sheets are removable giving you the flexibility to use only the ones you need for each project, minimizing the clutter on your desk. There is enough room for 50 additional sheets, allowing you to add your own printed sheets to the collection, as well as additional sheets from the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>expansion kitsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ we are planing to release in the future.       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        The first pre-release units were delivered to us by our manufacturing partner a couple of weeks ago and I must say they look amazing! The pictures don't do justice to how great it looks and feels. Bear in mind that these pre-release copies were printed using digital printing technology. Also, the colors may look duller due to the color grading applied to the pictures. The books will be printed using offset printing technology, achieving much more vibrant colors and professional quality results!   We want to support local manufacturing in Spain, that's why we partnered with a printing company that has been making high quality print media for more than 35 years in the south of Madrid. By doing this, we can also reduce lead times for manufacturing and shipping, and oversee the full production to ensure that the book will meet our strict quality standards.

But they don't teach you anything about the circuit at first glance, what you do when you use them is copy the diagram on your breadboard mechanically...  Breadboard diagrams will be available online as well, but we encourage you to assemble the board using the circuit diagrams and use the breadboard diagrams only to make sure all the connections are properly made and nothing is missing.

With the feedback we're receiving from our reviewers, plus your feedback during the campaign, we will be able to have the book ready by the end of the campaign. Our manufacturing partner will be notified in advance and the manufacturing process will begin right after the campaign ends. We are confident that all rewards will be shipped in August.  Shipping will be done with one fo the best global fulfilment companies. We're doing everything we can to offer affordable shipping to all of you, but unfortunately it's not easy to do it for some countries, considering the complexity of the logistics and that the book weighs almost 1kg. ABC: Basic Connections will be shipped from the US to our US backers.   Back in 2013 and thanks to more than 2800 backers on Indiegogo, I was able deliver more than 4000 units of ABC: The Book around the world. Unfortunately, no more copies were printed after the campaign.   ABC: Basic Connections features a completely redesigned version of each circuit diagram found in the 2013 edition of ABC, plus many more unreleased designs.  More than 100 sheets (200+ pages!), more than double compared to the 2013 edition of ABC.     Disclaimer   I have no relationship with Arduino (the company). When I say ""Arduino"", I'm referring to the ecosystem and the community.  I would like to remark that right after the rewards of my ABC: The Book campaign back in 2013 were delivered, and after countless headaches and less hair on my head, I severed all ties with smARtMAKER, Inc., the company that was responsible for managing the fulfilment and the campaign. We have absolutely no relationship with them. For this campaign, my team and I are 100% in charge of design, publishing and fulfilment. ;)      Risks and challenges  Our manufacturing partner has proven to be reliable and reachable at all times. It's a family run business that has been producing high quality print media for the past 35 years. They are based in the south of Madrid, a short drive away from our office. We have toured their company and manufacturing facilities and inspected some of the finished products they were making and the results look and feel amazing. However, will be overseeing the manufacturing process actively to make sure everything is done according to our specifications. ;)  Back in 2013 and thanks to more than 2800 backers on Indiegogo, I was able deliver more than 4000 units of ABC: The Book around the world swiftly and hassle-free. For this campaign, lead times will be shorter and everything will be under our direct supervision.  In order to make this book affordable enough, we need to print at least 2000 copies. Printing in Europe is more expensive than doing it in China, we need your help to keep the costs low, please share this campaign with your friends and colleagues and help us spread the word!! :D  With your feedback, we can make the book even better! Please send us your comments at  feedback@abcthebook.com   If the campaign is successful, I will be dedicating much more time to making more and more content. Thank you very much to all of you for supporting the creation of more circuit diagrams and pinouts for the past years!   &lt;3 PighiXXX"

Al ir de pie subimos el centro de gravedad, somos mÃÂÃÂ¡s inestables y es mÃÂÃÂ¡s difÃÂÃÂ­cil de dominar. En un recorrido largo o cuando estamos aprendiendo nos sentamos para descansar o estabilizarnos y no hay una forma cÃÂÃÂ³moda de hacerlo. Existen asientos para los paddle surf copiados de los kayaks pero no son nada cÃÂÃÂ³modos.       Espalda recta y comodidad en las piernas, rodillas y tobillos. Al mismo tiempo podemos cambiar de posiciÃÂÃÂ³n y llevar dos remos fÃÂÃÂ¡cilmente, de una pala para ir de pie y de dos palas para ir sentado. El PaddleSit multiplica las posibilidades de uso.    ÃÂÃÂ¿QUÃÂ<U+0089> ES EL PADDLE SIT?        El PaddleSit es un nuevo concepto de asiento para el Paddle Surf, estÃÂÃÂ¡ diseÃÂÃÂ±ado para ir de rodillas, con unos cojines ligeramente elevados donde apoyar las piernas que imitan la forma del empeine y un asiento central que se puede regular en altura e inclinaciÃÂÃÂ³n, repartiendo el peso del cuerpo de forma equilibrada. Esta posiciÃÂÃÂ³n es tan cÃÂÃÂ³moda que es habitual realizarla en yoga y meditaciÃÂÃÂ³n.ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ¿CÃÂ<U+0093>MO SENTARSE EN EL PADDLESIT?ÃÂÃÂ        El PaddleSit tienen varias opciones de uso, todas estas alternativas lo convierten en un aparato muy versÃÂÃÂ¡til que nos permitirÃÂÃÂ¡ multiplicar las posibilidades de este deporte, por ejemplo si hacemos una travesÃÂÃÂ­a ejercitaremos mÃÂÃÂºsculos diferentes y ÃÂÃÂ haremos un ejercicio mÃÂÃÂ¡s completo. Uno de los inconvenientes del paddle surf es que hace falta un poco de prÃÂÃÂ¡ctica para aprenderlo. Con el PaddleSit usted lo podrÃÂÃÂ¡ disfrutar desde el principio.  Otro de los problemas habituales es que un poco de viento hace que nuestro cuerpo actÃÂÃÂºe como vela y nos puede dificultar volver a la orilla. El PaddleSit aumenta nuestra estabilidad y nos proporciona una potencia extra que nos puede sacar de un apuro si las condiciones meteorolÃÂÃÂ³gicas empeoran.ÃÂÃÂ    POSICIÃÂ<U+0093>N PRINCIPAL: DE RODILLASÃÂÃÂ        El PaddleSit estÃÂÃÂ¡ diseÃÂÃÂ±ado para sentarse de rodillas, esta posiciÃÂÃÂ³n es poco habitual para la mayorÃÂÃÂ­a de la gente pero es sorprendentemente cÃÂÃÂ³moda y perfecto para mantener la espalda recta.ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ  SEGUNDA POSICIÃÂ<U+0093>N: SENTADO ÃÂÃÂ        Uno de los puntos fuertes del PaddleSit es la posibilidad de cambiar de posiciÃÂÃÂ³n al contrario que los kayaks. Cualquier postura se hace incÃÂÃÂ³moda si se mantiene mucho tiempo, de esta forma podemos usarlo como un asiento convencional inclinando el asiento central casi vertical para usarlo de respaldo tal como se ve en el dibujo. Con un poco de prÃÂÃÂ¡ctica usted podrÃÂÃÂ¡ cambiar de posiciÃÂÃÂ³n en ruta.ÃÂÃÂ    TERCERA POSICIÃÂ<U+0093>N: DE PIEÃÂÃÂ        El PaddleSit dispone de un alojamiento central que nos permite llevar un segundo remo, esto es muy ÃÂÃÂºtil si queremos remar de pie, posiciÃÂÃÂ³n para la que el paddle surf fue diseÃÂÃÂ±ado. Para ello cambiamos de remo y desplazamos un poco hacia delante el PaddleSit para situarnos en el centro y remamos normalmente   CUARTA POSICIÃÂ<U+0093>N: TUMBADOÃÂÃÂ        Esta posiciÃÂÃÂ³n nos permite relajarnos al mÃÂÃÂ¡ximo, ÃÂÃÂ¡incluso remar!, usando el asiento central como reposacabezas. Para ello puede despegar el velcro de los cojines de las piernas y darles la vuelta.   OTROS USOS       Una de las posiciones habituales de meditaciÃÂÃÂ³n en yoga es la llamada ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>postura del hÃÂÃÂ©roe ÃÂÃÂ³ VirasanaÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ, que consiste en sentarse de rodillas ayudado de un banco de meditaciÃÂÃÂ³n. El PaddleSit facilita esta posiciÃÂÃÂ³n haciÃÂÃÂ©ndola mÃÂÃÂ¡s cÃÂÃÂ³moda. permitiendo la espalda recta y las piernas relajadas sin forzar los tobillos.  La versatilidad del asiento nos permite como hemos visto numerosas posibilidades limitadas sÃÂÃÂ³lo por nuestra imaginaciÃÂÃÂ³n. Podemos utilizarla como hemos visto como accesorio en el yoga, como asiento en una mesa baja, para trabajar en lugares bajos, etc.  EN PAREJAÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        El PaddleSit nos proporciona una gran estabilidad que permite que lo usen dos personas en una misma tabla, con la combinaciÃÂÃÂ³n que nos sea mas cÃÂÃÂ³moda, de rodillas o sentado.   ÃÂÃÂ¿Y CÃÂ<U+0093>MO FIJAMOS EL PADDLESIT A LA TABLA?ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        El PaddleSit estÃÂÃÂ¡ concebido para que no necesite ser amarrado a la tabla. La mayorÃÂÃÂ­a de las tablas de paddle disponen de una superficie de gomaeva de gran adherencia por lo que el PaddleSit no se moverÃÂÃÂ¡. Por esta razÃÂÃÂ³n no suministramos correas de fijaciÃÂÃÂ³n. Al estar suelto lo podemos desplazar hacia delante cuando vayamos a remar de pie para situarnos en el centro de la tabla.  No obstante hemos diseÃÂÃÂ±ado el PaddleSit con unos agujeros laterales que usted podrÃÂÃÂ¡ utilizar para atarlo a la tabla mediante correas si lo considera conveniente. Otra opciÃÂÃÂ³n es atarlo simplemente con un leash o invento a la tabla para que en caso de volcar no se separe de esta.  ÃÂÃÂ Y si se cae al aguaÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦ÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂ¡ Flota !! No lo vas a perder fÃÂÃÂ¡cilmente.ÃÂÃÂ    PADDLE SIT PARA EMPRESAS       Por su elegancia y simplicidad, el paddle surf es un deporte de moda. En todos los lugares de costa, rÃÂÃÂ­os o lagunas interiores hay empresas que lo ofrecen para alquilar o para dar cursos. El inconveniente es que es un poco mÃÂÃÂ¡s difÃÂÃÂ­cil que el kayak y se necesita un poco de prÃÂÃÂ¡ctica. El  PaddleSit  ofrece a las empresas la posibilidad de hacer travesÃÂÃÂ­as utilizando un remo de doble pala a modo de kayak que da a la tabla potencia similar y estabilidad mejorando ademÃÂÃÂ¡s la comodidad. De esta forma podemos hacer tramos de pie con el remo de paddle surf alternando posiciones de sentado, de rodillas o de la forma tradicional, ofreciendo una actividad mÃÂÃÂ¡s completa y divertida. Las empresas que incluyan en el alquiler, actividades o cursos de paddle surf, con el  PaddleSit  destacarÃÂÃÂ¡n sobre la competencia.ÃÂÃÂ    DISEÃÂ<U+0091>O       El  PaddleSit  estÃÂÃÂ¡ diseÃÂÃÂ±ado en primer lugar pensando en la comodidad, realizamos numerosos prototipos para llegar a este resultado. Por ejemplo, la altura de los cojines para las piernas es crÃÂÃÂ­tica, cuanto mÃÂÃÂ¡s altos mÃÂÃÂ¡s cÃÂÃÂ³modo es el asiento pero demasiado altos nos elevan con respecto a la tabla y hacen la remada mÃÂÃÂ¡s incÃÂÃÂ³moda, llegamos a esa soluciÃÂÃÂ³n despuÃÂÃÂ©s de probar multitud de combinaciones. La soluciÃÂÃÂ³n de fijarlos con velcro nos permite colocarlos en la posiciÃÂÃÂ³n para que se adapten perfectamente al ÃÂÃÂ¡ngulo del empeine. La posibilidad de regular el asiento central nos permite inclinarlo mÃÂÃÂ¡s o menos segÃÂÃÂºn la situaciÃÂÃÂ³n. Por ejemplo, cuando queremos mÃÂÃÂ¡s velocidad aumentamos la potencia de remada e inclinamos nuestro cuerpo hacia delante regulando el asiento para ese ÃÂÃÂ¡ngulo determinado. En cambio si remamos de forma mÃÂÃÂ¡s relajada nos conviene el asiento mÃÂÃÂ¡s horizontal.  Para la estÃÂÃÂ©tica buscamos una soluciÃÂÃÂ³n minimalista. El paddle surf es en sÃÂÃÂ­ mismo un modelo sencillez, una tabla plana y un remo. Por eso evitamos diseÃÂÃÂ±os complicados y ostentosos.   MATERIALES DE CALIDAD  Elegimos, no obstante materiales de calidad, como:   ÃÂÃÂ  Gomaespuma de cÃÂÃÂ©lulas cerradas.  No absorbe el agua, por lo que  flota .    ÃÂÃÂ  Tapizado  ÃÂÃÂ de un material  adaptado a las condiciones marinas  y suave al tacto.ÃÂÃÂ     Piezas metÃÂÃÂ¡licas todas  inoxidables  de acero y aluminio.ÃÂÃÂ     Base plÃÂÃÂ¡stica realizada en un material  100% reciclable  reÃÂÃÂºne las propiedades de resistencia y rigidez que buscÃÂÃÂ¡bamos.ÃÂÃÂ    Nuestro compromiso es que el  PaddleSit  tenga una vida lo mÃÂÃÂ¡s larga posible para evitar la obsolescencia, para ello hemos usado en su construcciÃÂÃÂ³n materiales durables y nos comprometemos a suministrar cada uno de los elementos por separado.   ASÃÂÃÂ EMPEZÃÂ<U+0093> TODO       NacÃÂÃÂ­ y me criÃÂÃÂ© junto al mar en el Parque Natural de Cabo de Gata, un lugar fantÃÂÃÂ¡stico de acantilados volcÃÂÃÂ¡nicos y aguas transparentes, con fondos marinos repletos de vida. Me encanta el Cabo de Gata y acabÃÂÃÂ© trabajando en ÃÂÃÂ©l como guÃÂÃÂ­a marino en  El cabo a Fondo,  donde realizo excursiones guiadas en barco.ÃÂÃÂ   El Paddle surf me llamÃÂÃÂ³ la atenciÃÂÃÂ³n desde el principio y en cuanto lo probÃÂÃÂ©, me enganchÃÂÃÂ³.ÃÂÃÂ Con el paso del tiempo el Cabo de Gata ha pasado de ser un lugar aislado y desconocido a ser apreciado cada vez por mÃÂÃÂ¡s gente, por la belleza limpia de su paisaje semidesÃÂÃÂ©rtico. Las actividades marinas como el kayak han proliferado al calor de la gente que busca hacer ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>turismo activoÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ en lugar de quedarse ÃÂÃÂºnicamente tostÃÂÃÂ¡ndose al sol. Yo me preguntaba porquÃÂÃÂ© el paddle surf, siendo un deporte estÃÂÃÂ©ticamente tan bonito y completo no terminaba de cuajar. La respuesta es que es mÃÂÃÂ¡s difÃÂÃÂ­cil, no todo el mundo se sube a la primera, se avanza menos que un kayak y le afecta mÃÂÃÂ¡s el viento, por lo que no era adecuado para una travesÃÂÃÂ­a.ÃÂÃÂ   Si querÃÂÃÂ­a dar mÃÂÃÂ¡s versatilidad la paddle surf habÃÂÃÂ­a que ponerle un asiento. Me puse a buscar si habÃÂÃÂ­a sillas adaptadas para la tabla y encontrÃÂÃÂ© las mismas sillas de los kayaks. Las probÃÂÃÂ© pero me resultaron incÃÂÃÂ³modas. Me fijÃÂÃÂ© entonces en cÃÂÃÂ³mo se sentaba la gente para no perder el equilibrio y la  forma mÃÂÃÂ¡s habitual es de rodillas , una posiciÃÂÃÂ³n que ofrece una buena remada pero que es muy incÃÂÃÂ³moda. DebÃÂÃÂ­a de haber entonces una silla que se adaptara a esta postura. BusquÃÂÃÂ© en internet y no encontrÃÂÃÂ© nada, encontrÃÂÃÂ© sillas ergonÃÂÃÂ³micas de oficina y numerosas e ingeniosas soluciones para los trabajadores de la construcciÃÂÃÂ³n que estÃÂÃÂ¡n muchas horas de rodillas pero nada para el paddle surf. AsÃÂÃÂ­ que me ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>arremanguÃÂÃÂ©ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ y me puse manos a la obra. Pronto descubrÃÂÃÂ­ que una cosa es tener una idea que funcione y otra muy distinta es fabricarla y venderla. Afortunadamente mi amigo Liberto vino al rescate.  Liberto es propietario junto con su familia de  Carretillas Amate , esta empresa innovadora ha revolucionado el trabajo de la agricultura de AlmerÃÂÃÂ­a con nuevas soluciones para invernaderos. Puntera a nivel mundial han desarrollado incluso un nuevo modelo de tractor, La tizona, adaptado para trabajar en lugares estrechos. Esta empresa tenÃÂÃÂ­a la experiencia y capacidad necesaria para hacer un producto de calidad.ÃÂÃÂ   Liberto es ademÃÂÃÂ¡s un gran aficionado al mar y a los deportes de remo, enseguida captÃÂÃÂ³ las ventajas de la idea y decidimos asociarnos para este proyecto. Con su empuje y experiencia, el  PaddleSit  ha pasado de ser un prototipo a obtener el acabado profesional que buscamos y aquÃÂÃÂ­ tenÃÂÃÂ©is el resultado.   ENGLISH VERSION  SUP, Paddle Surf, or Stand Up Paddle Board is a fantastic sport. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s as close as you can get to walking on water but it doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t have the stability of a kayak. As you stand up, your center of gravity rises with you and you become more unstable. Managing the board becomes more difficult. On a long trip or while you are still learning, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll want to sit and rest or just get your balance back and normally there is no comfortable way to do it. There are kayak style seats available for paddle surfers, but these really donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t give you the comfort and support you need       A straight back and comfort and support for legs, knees and ankles. PaddleSit allows you to easily change your position, and there is space for you can carry an additional paddle, a main paddle for standing and a kayak style paddle for sitting.  PaddleSit  gives you a variety of new ways to use your SUP.  WHAT IS THE PADDLE SIT?        PaddleSit  is a new seat concept for Paddle boards. It is designed to be used in a kneeling position, with slightly elevated ergonomically designed cushions to support your legs and a seat that can be adjusted for both height and angle, distributing your weight and giving you maximum balance. This position is so comfortable that youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll find terrestrial versions of the set in yoga and meditation classes.   HOW TO SIT IN THE PADDLESIT?  There are several ways you can use  PaddleSit. ÃÂÃÂ  This flexibility extends your enjoyment of the sport, and allows to participate in a wider range of conditions. ÃÂÃÂ YouÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll exercise different muscles groups depending on the position you adopt, and get a more complete workout. One of the disadvantages of Stand Up Paddle Board is that you need a little practice to get started. With  PaddleSit  you can get on the water and enjoy your board from day one.       Another common problem is that a little wind makes your body act like a sail and can make it difficult to return to shore. The  PaddleSit  increases your stability and gives you ÃÂÃÂ that  extra power  that can get you out of a jam if weather conditions start to deteriorate.  MAIN POSITION: KNEELINGÃÂÃÂ        The  PaddleSit  is designed to be used in a kneeling position. ÃÂÃÂ Although not immediately familiar, this position is surprisingly comfortable and perfect for keeping your  back straight .   SECOND OPTION: CONVENTIONAL.       One of the strong points of  PaddleSit  is the  possibility to change  to a sitting position. Any position becomes uncomfortable if it is held for a long time. This way we can use Paddlesit as a conventional seat inclining the central seat almost vertically to use as a backrest. With a little practice you will be able to change position on the go.  THIRD OPTION: STANDINGÃÂÃÂ        The  PaddleSit  has a central housing that  allows you to carry a second paddle , this is very useful if we want to paddle standing, the position for which the paddle surf was designed. To do this we change paddles and move the PaddleSit a little forward to place ourselves in the center and paddle normally.   FOURTH OPTION: LAYING DOWNÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ This position allows us to relax as much as possible, even whilst paddle,  using the central seat or the leg cushions as headrests . To do this, you can detach the velcro from the leg cushions and turn them around.  OTHER USES       A common position for yoga meditation is the so-called ""Hero PoseÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ or ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Virasana"", which consists of sitting on your knees helped by a meditation bench. The  PaddleSit  facilitates this position making it more comfortable, allowing you to keep your  back straight  and  legs relaxed  without putting undue force on your ankles.   WITH A FRIEND         PaddleSit  gives you much more stability on your board. ÃÂÃÂ You can even take a friend with you. ÃÂÃÂ WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>d recommend you adopt a sitting or kneeling position if you are taking a passenger.   HOW TO ATTACH THE PADDLESIT TO YOUR BOARD        You donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t need any special equipment or ties to attach your Paddlesit. Most paddle boards have a high grip rubber surface so the  PaddleSit  will not move. No fixing straps are needed. As your PaddleSit is not fixed, you can easily move it forward on your board when you choose to paddle standing up and need to stand in the center of your board.  However we have designed the  PaddleSit  with some side holes that you can use to tie it to the board with straps if you prefer. Another option is to tie it simply with a leash to the board so that in case of overturning it does not separate from it.  And if it falls into the water...  it floats !! You're not going to lose it easily.   PADDLESIT FOR COMPANIESÃÂÃÂ        Elegance and simplicity makes paddle surfing a fashionable sport. On the coast, rivers or inland lagoons youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll find companies that offer boards to rent or who are giving courses. The disadvantage is that it is a little more difficult to get started than kayaking for example, ÃÂÃÂ and a little practice is needed. YouÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be able to take clients with a wider range of skills on your routes. ÃÂÃÂ Giving your clients the option of changing positions, also allows for a more varied and complete fun activity.  Companies that include  PaddleSit  in their rental, activities or courses, are going to stand out from the competition.   DESIGNÃÂÃÂ         PaddleSit  is designed primarily with comfort in mind, we made numerous prototypes before we got it just right. For example,  the height of the leg support is critical , the higher the seat the more comfortable it is, but the higher we are, the less comfortable it is to paddle. It took us several iterations to get this right. ÃÂÃÂ Making the leg supports adjustable, allows the user to tailor the shape easily to their body form. ÃÂÃÂ Allowing the back support/seat to tilt, means that you can adjust it for power paddling by inclining the body forward. ÃÂÃÂ Tilting it back, gives a more relaxed position for a gentler activity.  For aesthetics we looked for a minimalist solution. The paddle surf is in itself a simple model, a flat board and an oar. That's why we have avoided complicated and ostentatious designs.  QUALITY MATERIALS  We choose quality materials such as:   Closed-cell foam. It does not absorb water, so it floats.    Upholstered in a material adapted to marine conditions and soft to the touch.    Metallic pieces all stainless steel and aluminum.    Plastic base made of a 100% recyclable material combining the properties of resistance and rigidity that we were looking for.   Our commitment is that the  PaddleSit  has as long a life as possible to avoid obsolescence, for this reason we have used durable materials in its construction and we are committed to supplying each of the elements separately.   ÃÂÃÂ  THAT'S HOW IT ALL STARTED. ÃÂÃÂ        I was born and raised by the sea in Cabo de Gata Natural Park, a fantastic place of volcanic cliffs and clear waters, with seabeds full of life. I love Cabo de Gata and ended up working on its waters as a marine guide at the deep end where and I do boat routes at the company  El Cabo a Fondo . Paddle surfing caught my attention from the beginning and as soon as I tried it, I was hooked.  With the passing of time Cabo de Gata has gone from being an isolated and unknown place to being appreciated by more and more people for the clean beauty of its semi-desert landscape. Marine activities such as kayaking have proliferated, with people seeking to do ""active tourism"" rather than just sunbathing. I wondered why paddle surfing, being such an aesthetically pleasing and complete sport, wasnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t more popular. The answer is that it is more difficult, not everyone will be able to stand and paddle first time out, you cover less distance than with a kayak and your more affected by the wind. ÃÂÃÂ Altogether this makes the SUP less than ideal for long and medium distance trips.  If you wanted to give more versatility to paddle surf, it needed a seat. I began to look if there were seats adapted for paddle boards, but the only thing I found were based on lightweight kayak seats. I tried them but they were uncomfortable. I then looked at how people sat so as not to lose their balance and the most common pose is kneeling, a position that offers a good paddle but is very uncomfortable. There had to be a chair to suit this position. I searched the internet and found nothing, I found ergonomic office chairs and numerous ingenious solutions for construction workers who are on their knees for many hours but nothing for paddle surfing. So I I set to the task. I soon discovered that it's one thing to have an idea that works and another to make it and sell it. Fortunately my friend Liberto came to the rescue.  Liberto runs the family business  Carretillas Amate , this innovative company has revolutionized the work of agriculture in Almeria with new solutions for greenhouses, even developing a tractor to work in confined spaces, which it markets internationally. This company had the experience and ability to make a quality product.  Liberto is also a great fan of the sea and paddle sports, he immediately grasped the advantages of the idea and we decided to partner for this project. With his drive and experience, the PaddleSit has gone from being a prototype to obtaining the professional finish we are looking for and here you have the result.

The Monster Scooter V1.0 and What's-Inside-It Video   It took me months of watching Youtube videos, Wikipedia research, and doing things myself to figure out how to make the electric scooter that I wanted. Some of the questions I had were: What type of batteries should I use? How do I build a battery pack on my own? How on earth do I start welding? Should I attend a course? What type of welder should I buy?ÃÂÃÂ I want to shorten this gap for you and share all of the knowledge I gained.  I will make some important improvements like: use a much more efficient motor (with the same budget) to increase power in the back axle by at least 30%, have less friction, be much lighter, thinner body, have a foldable handle, be easier to build, and sexier overall.  If you want to see every component in detail, check the video below.         You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

The Technology Inside of The Monster Scooter V2.0 (it doesn't matter if you don't understand this... you will)    Aiming over 40km/h max speed.    Aiming over 30km of range.    78 x 18650 Li-Ion batteries (same batteries used in Tesla vehicles) in 13 series and 6 parallel which becomes a 48V, 20A battery pack.    Great battery output: 960W of battery output power (4x more powerful than typical street scooters).    Massive battery capacity: 865.8Wh of power capacity (3x more than typical street scooters).    1000W motor controller with electronic throttle (with battery life indicator and key switch).    1000W BLDC motor or hacked alternator (depending on cost/benefit analysis).    Slimmer, less bulky (30-40% less volume), and sexier than V1.0. Contents will be tightly packed.    Environmentally friendly.ÃÂÃÂ     Total parts cost will be around $600 USD - around 40% less than scooters with similar characteristics in the market (also cost optimizations compared to V1).    Designed and built with easily sourceable parts.              #4. The Skills That You Will Learn   This course is GREAT FOR BEGINNERS. You will learn skills that will allow you to make cool projects after this one. Plus, you'll have a kickass scooter to use.ÃÂÃÂ   Some of the most important skills I will be covering are:   Electronics for DIY projects (choosing batteries, battery management systems (BMS) , motor controllers, electronic throttles, electric motors, wiring and their gauges, etc.).    Homemade battery pack assemblies (series and parallel configurations).    Using precision tools (vernier calipers, rotary tools, etc.).    Welding with a MIG welder (flux-cored ""gasless"") and an electronic mask. This is the easiest method to weld at a low cost.    Steel plates and profiles gauges (and tricks to find them in a local blacksmith shop).    Using a grinder and a drill with different add-ons.    Building pillow block bearings from scratch for axles.    Building an oversized, bike disk breaking system from disks to clamps.    Assembling a custom power transmission system with a motorcycle chain and sprockets.    Using an air compressor for automotive painting.    Overall hacks to make the scooter simpler and sexier.    Soldering.    Using a multimeter.              #5. What's Inside The Monster Scooter Course    The most basic version of the course will consist of PDFs for all of the text-oriented and image content, and private Vimeo videos for the instructional walkthroughs (the PDFs will have links and passwords to the videos).   The Monster Scooter course will be very straightforward but rich in content. It will be organized as a walkthrough.   There will be an overall/introductory section that will explain the project overall.    The course will be divided into sections for each part of the scooter (e.g. Introduction, Battery System, Scooter Body, Axles, Disk Breaking System, Painting, etc.).    Each section will have a list of materials and tools that will be needed.    There will be multiple purchase links to all parts and tools. I will try to keep this as global as possible.    The entire building process (from the battery pack assembly to the paint and finishing) will be recorded and explained.    There will be instructional videos on how to safely use every single tool.    I will also mention all of the materials that can be bought at any local hardware store (nuts, bolts, drill bits, etc.).

This is cause for alarm.   It has been reported that more than half of middle school students have tried e-cigarettes.   With the use of new technology increasing, the number of adolescents and young adults addicted to nicotine is becoming easier. These products are not only addictive, but they also allow a large number of harmful chemicals to enter the body. E-Cigarettes are affecting the body. However, many do not realize they are also affecting the education of many students. Students are getting suspended from school at alarming rates because they are getting caught using e-cigarette devices.  Unfortunately, there is not a lot of information available to parents and schools about e-cigarettes. The mission of VapeEducate.com is to provide schools, administrators, parents, and concerned community groups with an additional tool to aid in the vape education of young adults. Education is what can bring change in order to allow our children to grow up as healthy adults.    Who can learn from this program?

(More on this below.) Which raises the question: Why weren't they manufactured long ago?ÃÂÃÂ   Learning from Segway     Segway    ÃÂÃÂ The  Segway  inventors solved the problem of balancing the inverted pendulum (the human body) about 20 years ago. But Segway's technology is not readily transferable to inline skates where two independent platforms (your feet) are involved in balancing a single load (your body).ÃÂÃÂ   When the Segway was under development the inventor and others such as Steve Jobs predicted a transportation revolution. Jobs who could usually sniff out the tech market better than a hound got this one wrong - the revolution never materialized. In the age of wearables, the Segway is not something you can wear. While it was definitely a technological mile stone it had too big a foot print. Enter the e-Bladez with the foot print of, well, a foot print, a low carbon one.ÃÂÃÂ   A question of balance  So what about balance?ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ That problem can be solved in one of two ways, a low tech solution or a high. It made sense for me to start with the simple and move to the more complex. ÃÂÃÂ So I went to work building my first low tech prototype. Some months later when I went to try them out in downtown Hinton, West Virginia, I knew on my first run that with some tweaking they could be used safely by the average person without a electronic balancing enhancement.     Prototype 1    ÃÂÃÂ At my initial test run I was 58. Now I'm 59. I'm not especially athletic, and I hadn't roller bladed in 20 years but within half an hour I had mastered them and enjoyed it too.ÃÂÃÂ  It's a exhilarating sensation accelerating in your own shoes.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ      Prototype 2    Fresh air + exercise + sunlight + recreation - emissions = SPT (Sensible Personal Transportation.)

ÃÂÃÂ The lighter the skate the greater control, the less fatigue and greater range. ÃÂÃÂ The skates are as light or lighter than some inline skates. ÃÂÃÂ This also allows for rapid pack replacement. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ And the switch will be on the pack within easy reach.      e-Bladez with Swell boot option by Powerslide       e-Bladez with doop Powerslide boot - strap onto your own foot wear.

Recommended Gear   Carbon poles for complete upper body workout,ÃÂÃÂ  as range extenders and for beginners    Helmet, elbow, wrist and knee protection   OperationÃÂÃÂ   Clip on and connect your battery pack and skates, turn on the hand-held remote control, turn on the battery pack, push off then apply power.ÃÂÃÂ  Carbon poles and powering one skate at a time is recommended for beginners.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   PerformanceÃÂÃÂ   1400 watts will accelerate you up and over almost any grade.ÃÂÃÂ  A top speed of 20 kph is faster than most will want to go.ÃÂÃÂ  Head, elbow, wrist and knee protection are recommended.ÃÂÃÂ   Safety  For beginners to inline skates, poles are helpful but not essential.ÃÂÃÂ  Get comfortable first in unpowered mode (they freewheel) then power one skate.ÃÂÃÂ  Once single power is mastered, dual power is the next step.ÃÂÃÂ  For commuters, powering one skate at a time extends the range.  EnergyÃÂÃÂ efficiencyÃÂÃÂ   So, how do these compare?ÃÂÃÂ  While an electric bicycle with its much larger wheels has less rolling resistance, a bicycle is also several times heavier. But, e-Blades have another edge: they naturally invite your input. Since you are already standing erect you naturally stride along making your own natural contribution. ÃÂÃÂ I notice their efficiency on my first trial. I wasn't expecting such good results. ÃÂÃÂ   Human powerÃÂÃÂ vs.ÃÂÃÂ Horse powerÃÂÃÂ   An athletic adult averages between 50 and 150 watts output for an hour of vigorous exercise. (50 to 150 watts is 1/16 to 1/5 horsepower.) So having 1400 watts of auxiliary power would be like having 14 fit menÃÂÃÂ  available to push you along or about 2 horsepower.ÃÂÃÂ  In real life, one fit person would be enough to push you along at a fast jog on level ground - about 60 watts.ÃÂÃÂ  You would rarely need fourteen fit men but they would come in handy climbing a steep hill or for pushing you into a storm-force headwind.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ Unless you like pushing the envelope you'll seldom need that kind of power, but it's nice knowing it's at your fingertips when you do need it.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  Quality control will be the first priority.  Two days ago I was talking to a middle manager for one of Intel's major service contractors and as I expected, quality control is Intel's first priority.  In this context that means the project will have time deadlines but quality will trump deadlines.  Because power is being increased over the prototype and because there are other less important changes as well, all of these will be thoroughly tested before the  production prototype is accepted.    Quality components will be sourced from reliable suppliers.  A major purpose in taking this project on is to provide training and employment for families and individuals in local communities which are being ravaged by opioids, alcohol and other things. Since I want to equip people with marketable skills, in addition to investing in CNC machinery and tooling we will also invest in skilled instructors and craftsmen.  Experienced machinists who are apt to teach and instruct will double as quality control personnel."

Going on this tour means that I have this magnificent chance to facilitate change from the ground up...and that's everything to me. It's the trip of a lifetime.""ÃÂÃÂ     - Melanie EwanÃÂÃÂ (Director of Community Based Research and Co-captain on this Canada-wide tour)   The Driving WinTech Journey  This fall,  Women in Tech (WinTech)  is conducting aÃÂÃÂ  Canada-wide research tour to   understand and record the experiences of women in technology  and toÃÂÃÂ promote vibrant women in tech communities across the country.ÃÂÃÂ   This adventure will take us from  BC to Newfoundland over a two month period . In this time we will:    Facilitate 50 community forums ÃÂÃÂ across the country.ÃÂÃÂ    Connect with over 10,000 people  from diverse communities and sectors.ÃÂÃÂ    Create and share a National Report  on the experiences of women in tech in Canada (barriers, challenges, successes, resources).   Create a set of Playbooks (regional recommendations) ÃÂÃÂ to facilitate more inclusive and diverse tech communities in Canada.   Share our  ÃÂÃÂ findings ÃÂÃÂ with community members and stakeholders to ensure active steps are taken as a result of Driving WinTech.   While there are smaller qualitative and quantitative studies and lots of anecdotal evidence of women's experiences in tech in Canada, no one has taken on a project of this magnitude or mandate before. Let's do this!ÃÂÃÂ      Driving WinTech: Connecting with women in tech across Canada      Who were those people in the video?  ÃÂÃÂ In the video above, you met the co-founders of WinTech,  Alicia Close  and  Elena Yugai , and the Director of Community Based Research,  Melanie Ewan . Alicia and Melanie will be hitting the road September 1st, 2017, with Elena and other members of the team joining them along the way.  What would success look like?  Great question! Our answer is two-fold:  (1) For tech ecosystem members and stakeholders to adopt policies and programs that are informed by our findings and recommendations (i.e. the experiences of women in tech, as reported by community members), and;ÃÂÃÂ   (2) To create a network across Canada of organizations and people who are working to elevate women in tech.  Why is this important?  We are living in an increasingly  tech-enabled world , which means that there are more and more jobs opening up in the tech sector. Problem is, while the Computer Science workforce has grown by 60% since 1991, the  percentage of young women going into the industry has declined  (Stats Canada 2011).ÃÂÃÂ And this isn't a matter of gender differences in education or interests:ÃÂÃÂ    As reported in Macleans , "" Despite an increase in women with STEM degrees , the percentage of women working in the fields has barely changed in almost 30 years.""     Women in STEM: Educations v. Workforce (Stats Canada)     What's going on here?   That's precisely what we are wondering. To date, there have been  no large-scale qualitative research projects  conducted on the lived experiences of women in tech in Canada. What are the existing resources and services available? Are there particular gaps or barriers that they face? What kinds of tools does a community need to create more inclusive tech communities?  As women in tech, we believe that every woman should have the opportunity to succeed in the tech industry.ÃÂÃÂ    Change starts by understanding what is really going onÃÂÃÂ  and by creating opportunities and tools for women in tech to connect with each other and meet women in leadership positions. Fostering these connections is incredibly empowering, allowing women to envision new possibilities for their careers in tech.     Youth Tech Day - WinTech Week 2017     This is why we are dedicated to increasing the knowledge of what is really going on in Canadian tech communities.ÃÂÃÂ   Creating change in the tech industry  The information we gather will be used to create a  National Report and set of guidelines  for Canada. The report will be qualitative, based on the interviews, focus groups, and community conversations that we facilitate.ÃÂÃÂ We will present this report to provincial and federal governments and will encourage groups to use it to launch local initiatives.   Our National Report and guidelines will:     Bring attention to key findings from the road trip, with the aim of increasing awareness across all sectors;  open doors for collaboration and funding opportunities for organizations in this field;  create best practices for how to mobilize communities, duplicate existing successes, and create inclusive and diverse tech communities across Canada.      Kickoff Breakfast - Women in Tech Week 2017    It's also important for us to celebrate and share the stories of the women and tech communities that we connect with. We plan to do this through our social media channels, blog posts, podcast and visual content. Creating a documentary from the road trip is definitely on our wish list as well!  About the Community Forums  We get that every community is different, with their own unique set of stakeholders, goals, and challenges. As such, we are creating a set of research activities that we can offer:   Community Conversations (e.g., breakout groups discussing the current ecosystem, including gaps and ideal outcomes)ÃÂÃÂ   The above + panel discussions (e.g., on current state of women in tech community, what resources and challenges exist)ÃÂÃÂ   Focus Groups with industry experts and officialsÃÂÃÂ    Each activity will provide a unique and interactive way to dive into important questions about the challenges and experiences held by women in the tech industry.     Youth Day - WinTech Week 2017    Why us?  WinTech is a truly unique organization made up of 140+ outstanding women in tech. The women leading this group are passionate and driven; they are professionals from diverse backgrounds in marketing and STEM who are dedicated to actively promoting, empowering, and celebrating women of all ages in tech.     Women in Tech Volunteer Team    We have organized over 22 events in seven cities across North America this year alone, and have given away $50,000 in tech scholarships to young women. We believe that by creating inclusive, collaborative, and diverse communities, we will be better equipped to take on new challenges that are thrown our way.     Women's Pitch Night - Women in Tech Week 2017    We count ourselves lucky to have a strong leadership team, and an extensive network of partners across Canada to support us on our mission. We couldn't do this without you!  Our Core Mission at Women in Tech  ToÃÂÃÂ work with communities, nationally and internationally, to define and execute actionable steps to increase the quantities of women in the technology sector, as well as the quality of roles available to these women (i.e., leadership positions). ÃÂÃÂ   Our Core Values:   Community  ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> To create a vibrant and collaborative network of women who work in tech communities across Canada (e.g., through research and events).   Empowerment  ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> To promote and provide access to mentorship and technical education, and sponsor high qualified, underrepresented tech talent.   Thought Leadership  ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> To showcase trailblazing women, create opportunities for community discussion, and commit to ongoing reporting and tracking of data on womenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s experiences.

Five WinTech volunteers are going to drive across the country in a branded RV, starting on the west coast (Vancouver headquarters), before heading north to the Canadian territories, and then east across the country to the Maritime provinces.ÃÂÃÂ   We will be hitting  all capital cities and major tech hubs , as well as  any spots identified by our community  (let us know if you want us to come to you!).       Our road trip team will be supported by a network of volunteers throughout the country, including provincial ambassadors who are plugged into the tech communities in their region.   Note: while Canada is the perfect place to start, being our home and headquarters, we intend to work with women in tech communities worldwide to identify other hubs that are keen to organize a Driving WinTech initiative.   What does the Kickstarter fund?  The biggest expense of any road trip areÃÂÃÂ the hidden costs of simply being on the road. Funds raised from thisÃÂÃÂ KickstarterÃÂÃÂ will cover the following costs for our two-month mission:    Power Up  - Fuel to get us across the country ($2,500)   Keep A Float  - Ferry costs over the water to Newfoundland ($1,300)   Stay Safe  - CAA membership and auto insurance to ensure assistance is readily available ($3000)   Lunch Money  - Food for our volunteers on the road ($12,200)*   Rest Up  - Accommodations for our volunteers from camp sites to couch surfing to bed and breakfasts ($4,575)*   Hot off the Press  - print and facilitation resources for the tech communities we visit ($6,550)    *every effort will be made to keep costs to a minimum. We want to ensure we can focus on our mission while having enough financial flexibility for those volunteering their time to reasonably continue the two-month tour.   We are actively seeking funds from sponsors and grants to pay for the upfront vehicle costs and the costs to run the town halls and produce the National report on the Status of Women in Technology. These costs are not included in our Kickstarter goal but are referenced in the video ($50K total mentioned to get us on the road).

ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  Our two key challenges are funding and people. The minimum that we need to go on this road trip is $30,000, however, that will just get us on the road. The more funding we can raise, the more communities we can visit, and the more resources we can put into creating truly impactful content. We are reaching out to past partners, setting up meetings with potential sponsors, and getting out the word on what we are doing through local events, networking, and the launch of our new website and brand.  In terms of people, this will be a huge undertaking. We are grateful to have two solid team members who can be part of the entire two-month road trip,  but they will need support along the way. We are currently working with the Women in Tech Directors to define teams and conduct interviews for our volunteer positions nation-wide."

ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ         Over 60% of the world sleeps on their side, yet...ÃÂÃÂ   the pillow industry has virtually ignored their need for a more supportive pillow that fits each individual's height needs, but is still comfortable. Side sleepers have largely been conditioned through the years to not expect to find a pillow that feels like it was made for us. We have had to fold our pillow, or stick our arm under it for our entire lives.ÃÂÃÂ   Today, common sense and technology have brought us exactly what we've needed.ÃÂÃÂ Meet the SleepSmart Pillow for side sleepers. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        The SleepSmart pillow can improve your sleep. And your life.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ       Get Cash Back on the Projects You Love!    ÃÂÃÂ         At SleepSmart, our vision is to help people rest better. We aim to be the worldÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s most trusted source for developing products that improve the quality of your life by improving the quality of your rest.  When we started this journey to build the perfect pillow for side sleepers, we gathered a lot of information from experts around the world, and lots of people just like you. We wanted to fully understand what people needed in order to get a good night's rest.ÃÂÃÂ        Over 60% of the population primarily sleep on their side, but we found that the pillows available for side sleepers didn't adequately meet their unique needs. Pillows are fixed and mass produced, so each one is only a solution for some. The fact is, side sleepers have different needs than back sleepers, and those needs vary significantly from person to person.ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ         How are side sleepers and back sleepers different?  The gap between your head and the surface of the mattress is what we refer to as the  Support Void . In order to keep your spine in proper alignment, your pillow should perfectly fill this space.       The Support Void also changes depending on the firmness of your mattress.       If you sleep on your side, then you can probably relate to all of these challenges.ÃÂÃÂ        Some pillows are designed to provide support, while others are designed to provide comfort. Consumers are generally forced to sacrifice one for the other. Not anymore.        Premium, soft materials that are hypoallergenic and 100% cotton. The stretchable and breathable AirMesh band around the comfort layer promotes airflow as you sleep.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Down-alternative comfort layer that offers low-friction characteristics for a luxurious feel.ÃÂÃÂ Including a 3D structured knit acting as a micro-cushion to provide additional comfort.       ÃÂÃÂ         ADJUSTABLE SUPPORT LAYER  -ÃÂÃÂ This component enables height adjustment, serving as the proprietary support layer that sits underneath the comfort layer. Air travels in and out of the bladder to increase or decrease the support height into the optimal position. This layer is comprised of soft, stretchable fabric that is airtight and heat sealed at production.   SENSING ÃÂÃÂ  SYSTEM  - We incorporated an air-pressure sensor into the air bladder. This enables us to accurately detect when your head is on the pillow as well as any additional motion associated with your sleep. The information is sent to your SleepSmart mobile app, which analyzes the data and provides valuable insights for improving your rest.    VIBRATION ALARM  - The inflation chamber uses vibration waves to create a silent alarm. The SleepSmart app can be used for time setting as well as controlling the intensity of the vibration. When enabled, thereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s an additional Smart Wake Time feature that will automatically wake you up while youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re in the lightest phase of your sleep cycle.         More than 2"" of height adjustment  for personalized support and comfort. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ         Lower the height ÃÂÃÂ by squeezing the valve while your head is on the pillow. ÃÂÃÂ         Raise the height ÃÂÃÂ by squeezing the valve while your head is off the pillow. ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ         Adjust valve easily  to find the perfect position you wish to sleep in.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ         Vibrating Smart Alarm  will help you wake up at the right time without disturbing your partner.       Our mobile app monitors your sleep, then leverages the data to teach you how to improve your rest. Now that's powerful.        ÃÂÃÂ         Track the metrics  that you want to see the most. Then make informed improvements so you can rest better.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ         Sound Monitoring Stats  -  shown with a demonstration app, not the app that will ship.

Our extensive research revealed that over 60% of the population are side sleepers, while in contrast most pillows are designed for those who sleep on their back. We also discovered a general lack of understanding around the importance of sleep. ÃÂÃÂ        We investigated over  100 ÃÂÃÂ  pillows . Our results proved that out of the pillows that are currently on the market, some are designed to provide support, while others are designed to provide comfort. Consumers are forced to sacrifice one for the other. ÃÂÃÂ        After years of market research, we spent  10 months  actively developing our product,ÃÂÃÂ rapidly iterating through prototypes and incorporating feedback. We tested 8 rounds of prototypes - always with the side sleeper in mind - and landed on a design that offers the ideal head and neck posture for this demographic. ÃÂÃÂ        We arrived at the  1 SleepSmart Pillow . A fully-adjustable design that offers both support and comfort. Accompanied with the SleepSmart mobile app, you can make informed improvements to your sleep and start living better.        Dr. Jae Son  is the CEO of an innovative technology company and holds a doctorate in Engineering Robotics from Harvard ( see LinkedIn profile here ). As an engineer and inventor, heÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s familiar with successfully bringing ideas to life. SleepSmart is one of those ideas, and was birthed out of a personal search for a solution. For years Jae had neck pains caused by deterioration of the spinal discs C3 and C4. Consequently, he struggled to find a pillow that could meet his comfort and support needs. He tried the typical folding the pillow in half, sleeping with an arm under his pillow, or even stacking two - but nothing was ideal. Then he discovered that by placing an inflatable pillow under his regular one, he could adjust the support height while still remaining comfortable. This was the beginning ideation of a new kind of pillow - and thus the SleepSmart pillow was born.       Brandon Larson  is a technologist with Red Bull studying how to improve elite athletes' and executivesÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> performance. He dedicated 6 months researching the science of sleep and evaluation of apps and trackers to understand what works and more importantly, what doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t. He has also been collecting personal sleep data for over 3 years in his quest to better understand the role of sleep in performance. What he discovered was that as a society, we have been focusing on minutia details of sleep enabled by technology. The most important factors of getting a good nightÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s rest are how long you sleep, how consistent your sleep routine is, and how you feel during the day. Combining this information with his approach to coaching was the inspiration for a more impactful way to track and interpret sleep data.

This was demonstrated previously with the production of several medical devices, which grew into companies such as SureTouch which won numerous awards.  Our goal is to deliver by December 2017. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve done our best to forecast demand, and we have already identified our suppliers and are actively working with a trusted logistics management company to ensure youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll get your rewards swiftly.   We want to ship as quickly as possible, but we also donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t want to ship products that are not fully tested. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll use the money collected through this campaign for testing design verification, environmental standards, and reliability. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll also use the support for translating the design from prototype to mass production, tooling for manufacturing, and purchasing materials."

ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  The biggest potential risks and challenges of this project are linked to the selection of suppliers for plastic injection, keyboard and assembly. Our team has strong experience in this field and we have eliminated these risks by taking the necessary time to select the right partners to offer the best support and the best quality.  Another challenge could be in the logistics and shipping to avoid mistakes and errors. Having seen the challenges some projects currently face with quality issues and delays in production, we preferred to go live with our project once all major product &amp; technology related questions were solved and our product was ready for manufacturing. To further limit this risk, we have invested in an ERP software platform which should prevent such problems and provide first class communication with the backers, avoid shipping to wrong addresses, etc.  We are proud to say that we have set everything well in place to guarantee the quality the backers expect and deserve, as well as to respect the promised delivery timeline."

Photos in video by Carolyn Fahm ( 1 ,  2 ),  Cindy Miranda , and  s_p_e_x .      Risks and challenges  The hardest part of putting on this event is making everything come together over the course of the two days: day one is setup, day two is the event itself. Because we're a small team, a forgotten extension cord or lamp can cause us to lose a key person's time for an hour or more. We address this by making lists, checking them twice, and bringing extra things (because stuff breaks, too).  The other obstacle is making sure we have the right makers to exhibit and create engaging experiences. Without a set of compelling exhibitors, we'd have a pretty boring event. Fortunately, the team members have wide and complementary networks of friends and collaborators to draw on, and we've already got over a dozen makers committed."

We've developed the product and production line, so we have no issues concerning our product reaching its audience of coffee drinkers. The product itself has several aspects that customers should be aware of while using. The first things our customers should know when using G-Presso is that our product has been made to be used with room temperature or cool and hot water. The second issue that could occur is that G-Presso could vibrate if coffee is not evenly pressed/tamped into the filter basket. For G-Presso to work quietly and smoothly, the coffee needs to be flat and even. However, if customers don't tamp evenly, G-Presso will still make coffee, the device will simply shake while operating. And if you work on a silicon pad provided by g-presso, the shaking can be reduced."

NuMicrobe  is introducing groundbreaking technology  in a way that you can try    yourself.

Sorry - Times Up!             Sorry - Times Up!                       PLANT GROWTH    NuMicrobe  offers a natural alternative to chemicals for the use of soil amendment, water treatment, agriculture and livestock health using a proprietary blend of probiotic bacteria.  Our proprietary blend is made up of several strains of aerobic bacteria, normally present in our world, they work together to balance any system they inhabit. This balance allows that system to function efficiently whether itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s in a pond, a compost, a garden, or even a cow!

It would take over 30 boxes of the leading chemical treatment, and cost you over $200, to equal the effectiveness of one box of Lawn &amp; Garden POWER.

In fact, ever since life was on the Earth, bacteria, fungi, and microorganisms have been key components for the life cycle of every living organism on the planet. These microscopic partners allow plants, animals, and humans alike to extract nutrients to use in various ways. Cells require organic bacteria and other ingredients to grow and function at their highest efficiency. Microbes along with other bacteria help living organisms create antibiotics, natural vitamins, and are a dominant factor in fighting disease.  In summation, life cannot exist without the help of bacteria.ÃÂÃÂ    We all know that human consumption of probiotic microbes keeps our bodies healthy, repopulates gut flora, and allows the body to heal itself naturally.

They will automatically, in real time, detect the ads and - according to your choice -  mute the ads, half mute, or even start your own playlist . So that you aren't bothered with the commercial breaks any more - and no one is!  We are creating it - the technology that will completely change your TV experience. And the landscape of TV business.   And there is also UNmute technology.   You have a workout in a gym. Hang out in a bar. Wander in an airport. Arrays of TV's flicker around. A Superbowl game, breaking news, your favorite show, presidential debate.. you name this. You want to watch it... yes, you can of course. But you cannot hear. All these TV's are muted.  Here comes our technology. It will  allow you to listen to the muted TV in a public facility , using your own headphones, through integration with the venue's infrastructure and using the app on your device.  The commercial beta release should be ready by upcoming October.  So exciting! Can you imagine this?   We can. And we know how to make it. In fact, we are already making it.   We've put together an  enthusiastic team  of hardware, software, and cable experts who created the first prototype. Under the hood are C#, ASP.NET, MS SQL, Azure cloud, and our proprietary algorithms for real time analysis and processing of TV signal.  We raised interest among  owners of chain businesses , such as sport bars and fitness centers. They are ready to roll out our technology in their premises and  bring excitement  to their customers.  We've got a promise from  prominent Instagram bloggers  - they will be happy to spread the message across  millions of their followers .  We are going to quickly roll out  nation wide , expand internationally, and  go public within 60 months .  This is going to be huge.  Today, we just need $99,999 to jump from currently existing software prototype to a  beta commercial release .  We are planning to engage a  strong 6-people team , who will complete the work within  12 weeks . We are planning to spend 90% of funds ($90K) to pay  developers and engineers , with remaining 10% for operational expenses (office, basic marketing and biz dev). We will also bring in a few interns who will will contribute for free.ÃÂÃÂ   Once we have the beta release - it will explode.  You are about to become a part of it.  Isn't this cool?   Join and pledge.ÃÂÃÂ     Your pledge makes you the hero changing the world of entertainment.    Invest as little as $9 and become eligible for great perks and benefits.       Risks and challenges  Each innovation project is associated with risks. We the ReMute team spent weeks talking through them, and we believe we have good consideration of them.  Here are the key challenges we are addressing:  1. The technology allowing real-time recognition of ads. No one has done this before (at massive commercial scale). This is a big technological challenge. We developed and tried out 4 (four) different methods to distinguish commercial contents, and they work. Some of them rely on hardware analysis of TV signal characteristics, others are software related. They all work in real time, with milliseconds of delay - i.e., practically instantly. Out of these 4, we will be able to pick the best.  2. Many innovation products fail because people don't buy them. This is not the case for our product. We talked to dozens and hundreds of potential clients. Businesses (like pubs and gyms) are extremely interested and are ready to adopt our technology in their venues. Individuals are excited to get rid of annoying ads. We will be able to reach out to the market, and we are confident that our product will be more than welcome.  3. Competition. In brief: no one has done this before, and there are no other products like ours. In fact, it looks like no one is getting any close to what we do. We welcome competition, but today it looks like we are grabbing the entire market.  4. Is it legal to suppress the ads? Yes, absolutely. As a user of your TV, you are free to turn it on, off, and adjust volume and picture the way you like it, when you want it, either manually or automatically.   5. By changing the user experience, we are going to shake the entire TV broadcasting market. The cable company will have to react, and we debated a lot what they will do. But, though we are changing the market, we are not killing cable companies. Though ads will reach less customers at homes - more people will start listening to ads in gyms, bars, airports, and other public places. All in all, cable companies will not lose their audience.  6. Financial sustainability of operations. Yes, we crunched lots of numbers to test our financial model. With an affordable subscription cost for end users, we expect to eventually engage hundreds of thousands of customers to ensure steady flow of revenue, so we can provide you with uninterrupted service."

Many innovations based on wind and solar energy have already been developed and realized in recent years.  In the meantime, unfortunately large wind turbines are already part of the public picture for supplying energy to townships and cities. However, these are built in windy areas and the electricity must be transported to consumers over long distances. In terms of environment this is not really the best solution. Plenty of power lines are necessary, land use and intervention in nature.  ÃÂÃÂ Why not producing electricity where it is really consumed. Best at your home. But how?  My project team and I have been brooded about this question for several years. A photovoltaic system makes sense, but you can produce electricity only in the daytime and when the sun is shining. Also think about that the weather extremes are increasing. Hot summers, but also windy autumn and winter days. And that's where you need electrical power.  This is where our ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> LITE ROT ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ micro-wind turbine comes into. CO2-neutral power production even at low wind speeds.   You already have a photovoltaic system, but want to produce your own electricity even in windy-bad weather? With the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> LITE ROT ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ you increase your independence and can cover your electricity costs    You have a cottage in the countryside or a garden plot? With our ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> LITE ROT ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ in conjunction with a solar panel you can switch off your annoying emergency generator.    You have a building with a flat roof? No matter which direction the wind blows, our ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> LITE ROT ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ produces electricity.    Help the technical aid organizations and civil protection with providing electrical energy population in emergency cases. The ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> LITE ROT ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ systems are fast and easy assembled.    Help people in poorer countries to stay Independent by producing their own electrical energy e.g. for having light or for using their water pumps. The currently used emergency generators are not the solution under environmental aspects and have permanent running cost. By using the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> LITE ROT ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ it is just a one-time investment.ÃÂÃÂ    But is a wind turbine really CO2-neutral, even if it is not made of sustainable materials? Not for us.ÃÂÃÂ   Due to many years of experience of the project members in different branches of industry, we have found combinations of materials not burden our environment. The keywords are renewable resources. We plan to build the frame out of wood and the blades should get their strength by using a compound made of hemp or coconut fibers. In addition innovative 3D printing nature-based materials are to be used, for example in the area of fasteners.  ÃÂÃÂ The goal is a ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> LITE ROT ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ with a base area of 2-2.5 sqm and a height of 2.0 m. The power is about 2KW.  The ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> LITE ROT ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ should be built either on house roofs or in the garden on stilts. Due to the design the running noise is low. With higher flow velocities ÃÂÃÂ the operation of the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> LITE ROT ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ is more efficient.  ÃÂÃÂ Are you also convinced that this will make a positive contribution to climate change possible? Then support us in the development of ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009E> LITE ROT ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> systems. ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  The LITE ROT wind turbine is a vertically rotating turbine. In order to increase the efficiency significantly, the air resistance of the blade running against the airflow must be as low as possible. Here we fold the wing blade and thus reduce the attack surface. We have already patented this concept. It is important here that the planned materials also endure the loading of the folding mechanism permanently."

Wordless game play encourages kids to form their own interpretations &amp; retell their stories.                    Augmented reality technology allows kids to interact with their devices in ways that mimic toy play.    We're finding this gesture based form of interaction in 3D space to be far more immersive than tapping on a screen.                         Kids refer to this physical map to orient themselves and locate their next missions.    A fun and tactile way to navigate!ÃÂÃÂ                                These collectible cards utilize Computer Vision technology and allow kids to customize Rubu.    Inspires curiosity as kids experiment with cards in different game play situations.                        Kids are clearly attracted to devices like iPads and tablets, but digital content isn't as enriching as it could be. Which is why parents encourage physical play, like toys, drawing, and colouring. Our goal was to combine the engagement of digital devices with the meaningfulness of physical play to create a magical experience for kids.ÃÂÃÂ        We believe we did just that. By combining digital and physical play, we brought out the  best  of both mediums, and developed an experience for kids that  encourages play  and  nurtures creativity .ÃÂÃÂ        Along the way weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve secured funding from the Canada Media Fund and Ontario Creates who validated and supported our approach. With their support, we were able to assemble an eclectic team to realize our collective vision.ÃÂÃÂ        Fast forward to now. The Rubu Adventure Kit is ready to launch. We truly believe weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re introducing children to a new world of play.ÃÂÃÂ   So from the whole Gepeto team (and Rubu!) we thank you for your support, and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re excited for you to join the adventure.                Risks and challenges  Our aim is to manufacture a high quality product thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s environmentally responsible and within budget. To achieve this, we are working with trusted advisors who have helped us estimate the realistic timeframe required for production; this valued partnership will assist in bringing the Rubu Adventure Kit to life. We donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t anticipate any major delays, but if any arise, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll contact our backers immediately and keep everyone in the loop."

ÃÂÃÂ The day I contacted my Patent Attorney for the first time to pitch the Beamon 1st Class Crank, he said to me that there were over 86,000 patents for bicycles alone. ÃÂÃÂ He then went on to say that most likely, what ever I had designed has already been thought of, but if I wanted his time, that I would have to provide a prototype. ÃÂÃÂ I figured that he wanted to inconvenience me to deter me from pursuing any further legal service from him. ÃÂÃÂ But, I was ready to demonstrate a prototype. ÃÂÃÂ There was one problem, it was winter and there was snow everywhere. ÃÂÃÂ I did not want him to put me off until spring, so I talked him into allow me to bring the prototype to his home and set it up on a stationary stand, so he could try it out for himself, which he did. ÃÂÃÂ I could tell by his willingness to try it, that he may not have seen anything like it before. ÃÂÃÂ The rest is like they say, is history.    ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ So, this is a summarized background of the Patent Pending Beamon 1st Class Bicycle Crank. ÃÂÃÂ There are several ways to convert a bicycle riderÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s physical exertion in to mechanical rotational power. ÃÂÃÂ In general, standard methods depend solely on selectable gear ratios to aide the bicycle rider when encountering increasingly resistant force while pedaling on uphill grades. ÃÂÃÂ And, while on that uphill grade, the rider on the bicycle, depends largely on the maintenance of forward momentum necessary to climb and summit each hill. ÃÂÃÂ The lose of that forward momentum increases the need for the rider to increase their exertion until either they summit the hill or fatigue and have to dismount and walk their bike the rest of the way up the hill.ÃÂÃÂ     ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ The standard bicycle crank is a bilateral mechanism, each side having one pedal arm attached at the center of rotation at one end and the pedal at the other end. ÃÂÃÂ This creates a 2nd Class leverage mechanism such as a wheel barrow or a water well handle. ÃÂÃÂ When the right side pedal arm is at the 12 oÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>clock position, the left side pedal arm is at the 6 oÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>clock position.    ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ The power stroke sector on the right side of the bicycle crank begins, when the pedal, in the up position, moves clockwise slightly forward of the 12 oÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>clock position and ends, when the same pedal approaches its 6 oÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>clock position. ÃÂÃÂ To propel, the rider and bicycle, forward, with a standard crank, the rider exerts a downward force on the right side pedal during the power stroke sector until the left side pedal reaches its 12 oÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>clock position. ÃÂÃÂ Then the same process is repeated on the left side, but counterclockwise.    ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ The right side crank arm rotates in a clockwise rotation when generating forward power and the left side crank arm rotates in a counterclockwise rotation when generating power. ÃÂÃÂ Alternating power strokes generates momentum and propels the rider on their bicycle forward. ÃÂÃÂ As described earlier, the maintenance of momentum is necessary for forward motion, especially on an uphill grade. ÃÂÃÂ On downhill and level grades the maintenance of momentum is easier and may even require no effort. ÃÂÃÂ Reason for this, is that the rider has less resistance when rotating the bicycle crank arms to the power stroke sector. ÃÂÃÂ But, as the rider on their bicycle encounters an uphill grade, it starts to lose momentum and gain resistance causing the rider to continuously pedal to sustain the rider and their bicycleÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s forward motion. ÃÂÃÂ At the point in time, when the rider has fatigued enough and is unable to reach the power stroke sector, on either side, all forward momentum will be lost. ÃÂÃÂ The rider will have to stop, dismount the bicycle and continue uphill on foot. ÃÂÃÂ The heavier the rider, the more likely and sooner they will encounter insurmountable resistance.    ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ The inspiration for the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Beamon 1st Class CrankÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ mechanism came from two incidents. ÃÂÃÂ I weighed roughly 240 lbs. My youngest children, Isabella and Gabriel, were roughly 125 and 150 pounds, respectively. ÃÂÃÂ I was 56 years old and they were 15 and 16 years old respectively, when these incidents occurred. ÃÂÃÂ In June 2017, we three, went out for a bike ride. ÃÂÃÂ Not for the lack of trying, I was always trying to catch them as they road ahead. ÃÂÃÂ When it came to the hills, I fell behind even farther. ÃÂÃÂ And, finally, the bicycle gods, wanting to give me a break and an excuse for falling behind, put a hill in front of me that I could not conquer. ÃÂÃÂ I was giving it my all, when finally my chain broke. ÃÂÃÂ If it hadnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t broken, I would have still quit due to fatigue unable to pedal another stroke. ÃÂÃÂ My children, realizing that I was no longer making progress, returned to find me vanquished. ÃÂÃÂ To add to my embarrassment, I hadnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t even made it a mile from home. ÃÂÃÂ But, in my defense, it was mostly uphill. ÃÂÃÂ The second incident took place shortly after that. ÃÂÃÂ My son, Gabriel, ask if I would allow him to ride from Pittsfield to Tyringham, on his bike. ÃÂÃÂ I agreed. ÃÂÃÂ This bike ride is about 15 and 1/2 Miles. ÃÂÃÂ Home is on Webster Rd in Tyringham. ÃÂÃÂ When you turn on to Webster Rd. from Main Rd., it is all uphill and about a 1/2 of a mile to my door. ÃÂÃÂ ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s about an 7% grade from point A, Main Rd, to point B, my door. ÃÂÃÂ The day my son did his ride, he pedaled nonstop from Pittsfield to Tyringham, with the toughest hill being the last portion of his ride. ÃÂÃÂ I was waitng out on the driveway and witnessed my son pedal right up this last hill to our house.ÃÂÃÂ     ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve always known that this can be accomplished by any young and fit person, especially one who bike rides regularly. ÃÂÃÂ But, l, am not nearly any of the above. ÃÂÃÂ I could have the momentum of a Mack Truck, while riding a bicycle and when I would turn onto Webster Rd. from Main Rd., I would grind to a stop within 100 feet. ÃÂÃÂ ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s right, IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>d hit the wall. ÃÂÃÂ ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a long walk uphill from there. ÃÂÃÂ Trust me, I do it all the time, especially when riding my bike. ÃÂÃÂ So, these are the two incidents that inspired this endeavor. ÃÂÃÂ My daughter once made me smile, because she said that I always turn everything into a learning experience. ÃÂÃÂ At first, I thought that she was complaining, but she quickly put me at ease, saying that she loved how it was always pertinent with the subject at hand. ÃÂÃÂ This endeavor was no exception.ÃÂÃÂ     ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ It was perplexing to Isabella and Gabriel how someone so big and strong, ME, could peter out so easily. Of course I havenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t told them that it is only my liposuction and silicone implants that make me look so fit. ÃÂÃÂ They donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t need to know this. ÃÂÃÂ IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m just joking! ÃÂÃÂ We went into the computer room and sat down to discuss ways we could make the effort of riding a bicycle uphill easier. ÃÂÃÂ Both of them have taken science classes and though cloudy, sort of remember the different types of sciences they have touched on. ÃÂÃÂ I asked them which of the sciences would be most helpful with this project? ÃÂÃÂ I think my son blurted out - Physics. I said, ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s correctÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ. ÃÂÃÂ I then asked them had they touched on levers and pulleys in any of their science classes. ÃÂÃÂ Though it seemed uncommitted, they both said yes. ÃÂÃÂ So, l asked them, ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>When looking at your bicycle, what kind of mechanism is the drivetrain, the pedals, sprockets and chain?ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Gabriel jumped on, that it was a lever. ÃÂÃÂ I clarified that it was both a lever and a pulley. ÃÂÃÂ Next question was, where in this mechanism, can we improve, to help, the big guy, ME, climb hills? ÃÂÃÂ By this time both were afraid to give a wrong answer, so I had to pry answers out of them. ÃÂÃÂ I asked them, ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> What changes, when they pedal up hill?ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Somebody said the gears. ÃÂÃÂ Somebody said that it gets tougher. ÃÂÃÂ And then someone said that you have to stand up on the pedals. ÃÂÃÂ That is where, I wanted them to go. ÃÂÃÂ I asked, ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> Why do you stand up?ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Gabriel said, ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>To put more weight on the pedals.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Then Isabella said, ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> It gives her more leverage.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ I told them, that they were both correct. ÃÂÃÂ I told them, that both of their actions work together to create a rhythm with, minute alternating shiftings, ( a little wordy there) of their weight, allows them to keep their weight over the pedal which is approaching the power stroke sector of its rotation. ÃÂÃÂ Did they understand any of that? ÃÂÃÂ I am not certain, but, It doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t matter, because these interactions are meant to train them to problem solve. One day, they will be better off, because of it. ÃÂÃÂ I hope!ÃÂÃÂ     ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ I then asked if either of them had ever heard of Archimedes? ÃÂÃÂ The look in their eyes said, - NO. ÃÂÃÂ I then told them his famous quote.    ""Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world."" - Archimedes    ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ Our discussion then turned to the different types of leverage systems. ÃÂÃÂ How many there are and how each works. ÃÂÃÂ I asked, ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>What lever system, from their observation, do they think the standard bicycle crank utilizes?ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ And, ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>What is the best way to improve on it?ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ We discussed everything that we have seen, but I knew that just because we have not seen it, does not mean that other things do not exist. ÃÂÃÂ Thus, began my search for what existed out in the bicycle world now. ÃÂÃÂ What I found, was pretty impressive. ÃÂÃÂ Many improvements were electric or electronic and weight reduction. ÃÂÃÂ But, from bikes costing more than $500,000 ( I couldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t believe it either, but it was on eBay ) down to the $100 cheappy, the crank systems were all the same, with one exception.    ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ This exception is the Penny-Farthing. The Penny-Farthing is that old bicycle with the very large front wheel andÃÂÃÂ a very small rear wheel. ÃÂÃÂ They are from the early 1800's. ÃÂÃÂ It utilizes a reciprocating bilateral mechanism, which I assume was borrowed from steam engine trainÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s technology from its time. ÃÂÃÂ This does not mean that it is the only exception, because humans are always trying to figure out a better way of doing everything. ÃÂÃÂ YouTube shows some amazing mechanisms for people propulsion. ÃÂÃÂ Some are simply awesome. ÃÂÃÂ Some are very complicated. ÃÂÃÂ All, are schools for thought. ÃÂÃÂ     ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ The ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Beamon 1st Class CrankÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ is designed utilizing a 1st Class lever. ÃÂÃÂ I have tried to keep the design of the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Beamon 1st Class CrankÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ as simple as possible. ÃÂÃÂ It would be possible to place the driving mechanisms on one side of the crank or even integrate it into a bicycle frame, but it would make for a more complicated engaging apparatus. ÃÂÃÂ This prototype is designed solely to demonstrate its feasibility. ÃÂÃÂ It is bulky and Frankenstein-esque. ÃÂÃÂ In fact, this prototype is made of steel, which when substituted for the original standard crank added a great deal of weight to the bicycle. ÃÂÃÂ But, because it is a 1st Class lever, the additional weight is rendered insignificant. ÃÂÃÂ Production models will be made of high grade aluminum. ÃÂÃÂ It will be anodized, powder coated, streamlined and made to look boldly attractive. ÃÂÃÂ I can not wait to see what this advancement in bicycling technology can do in the hands of those with the Right Stuff. ÃÂÃÂ But, first things first... We need your help to move from a Patent Pending Prototype in to full production. ÃÂÃÂ Make it happen!

The next paragraph shares my proposal. In my opinion, senior design should showcase the ingenuity and creativity of a graduating engineer. My project is realistic and involves actual numbers (provided at the bottom).  Here goes... Drones are a great new technology with the potential to change global conventions. Including emergency services such as life-saving drug transportation in developing nations, advanced firefighting, transporting AED's in distant or rural areas, etc. But what about construction and community infrastructure? Alongside life preservation, there needs to be development in construction. With the right design, a semi-flexible body of drones could replace the capabilities of a small or even medium size construction crane while providing for cheaper machinery costs, faster lifting, lesser space and traffic consumption, affordability, and a huge step in advanced construction. Plus, it'll be so cool!   Imagine   Glass sheet transport     Glass pane transport    Steel beam transport     Steel beam lifting    Imagine a third-world country capable of embracing progress and constructing larger hospitals and cities using the help of these drones. Imagine the progress a first world country could make.  As a mechanical engineer backed with a responsibility to use ideas to improve society and give back to my community, I implore the readers to fund to this cause.  This a great idea for advanced global infrastructure development. It's pretty awesome.   2 prototype designs:    Setup [1]   Eco-friendly choice!

Either way, this project is a proof of concept;ÃÂÃÂ   Setup [2] requires 108 to 216 components to be carefully adjusted and combined, providing more moving parts, larger room for error and time consumption, while providing greater stability and flexibility in design.  Setup [1] requires 18 to 36 components with less time consumption overall.  Super-drone will either be Setup [1] Hexcopter/Octocopter OR Setup [2] VI-Octo/XII-Octo. These designs will provide enough room for extra budget.  This conclusion does not include drone frame cost, nor flight controller software cost, nor the cost of shipping. Settling on a minimum budget of $4,500 to account for error.    Thank you.   All funds will go towards the project, the rest will be kept for future projects' funding.      Risks and challenges  Challenges will include thrust to weight ratios, stability, and design functionality.  In the end the drone will be a part of a modular and transforming drone, capable of lifting heavy material."

Send the Bass Fishing Lure to Production! ÃÂÃÂ   Looter Lure's goal with our Kickstarter is to use the raised money for new packaging, manufacturing molds, and advertising for our new Bass fishing lure... the Looter Ultra-vibe!ÃÂÃÂ      Ultra-Vibe Bass Fishing Lure           Backstory:ÃÂÃÂ    The Looter Lure was invented in the early 1980's on lake Michigan. It's been used ever since as it was tried &amp; proven by 3 generations of Professional Fishing Guides. The Looter Lure is a premium lure made from solid brass that is then platedÃÂÃÂ with jewelry quality silver &amp; gold.ÃÂÃÂ What makes the Looter LureÃÂÃÂ special is that its pure silver or gold qualityÃÂÃÂ will retain its color at any depth, which is where other metals and colors would loose their quality below certain water depths. The Looter Lure can be casted, trolled, or jigged, although its original purpose was intended to be trolled for salmon on the Great Lakes.ÃÂÃÂ   The Looter Lure was designed specifically for -ÃÂÃÂ    Looter Lure Salmon fishingÃÂÃÂ     Looter Lure Striped Bass FishingÃÂÃÂ     Looter Lure Large Mouth Bass Fishing    Looter Lure Walleye FishingÃÂÃÂ     Looter Lure Trolling    Looter Lure Casting    Looter Lure Jigging    Saltwater, Freshwater, Ice-fishing   But can be used anywhere, at any time!ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ      LOOTER LURE MAGNUM SILVER       Looter Lure Ultra-lite size 3 in Orange!        Looter Lure Original Silver     The Journey:ÃÂÃÂ    The Original Lures -ÃÂÃÂ   Looter Lure Co. started with a single concept for a lure that is still available in three sizes - Micro, Original, and Magnum. They are each made up of stamped brass disks, plated with Silver, that can be rearranged in any configuration simply with a pair of split-ring pliers. That idea grew and cultivated enough interest for us to engineer the same set in Gold, and then further into each coming in 2 different weights, one lighter and one heavier. These quality lures have certainly ""caught"" the hearts of fisherman and tackle shops from across the nation.ÃÂÃÂ   Looter Lasers + Ultra-lites -  Not long after the 12 Silver and Gold Lures hit the market, a new idea sparked in the form of fiber-optics! Thus, the Looter Laser was born. The 5 different sizes of Looter Lasers take the form of your favorite individual Looter Lure disks, with a circular fiber-optic color in the middle. You wouldn't believe the action these pieces add to the already impressive Looter Lure! After we had the pieces and started experimenting, the Ultra-lites were born. These lures are small but mighty, taking on all kinds of fishing trips, especially on the ice!ÃÂÃÂ The Lasers and the Ultra-lites come in 9 fiber-optic colors and 1 glow-in-the-dark color.ÃÂÃÂ   Check out our diagrams on how to customize the Looter Lures and Ultra-lites below.ÃÂÃÂ                        Why Looter Lure is better than your average lure:ÃÂÃÂ    Unlike most lures on the market, there is no wrong way to fish the Looter Lure. It is proven successful while fished at every single configuration you can think of.  The diagrams above are our suggestions, but they are not the only successful solutions!  This Lure is made to stimulate the creativity in every fisherman, and the fish are going crazy for it. We do, however, recommend a couple of different configurations for certain desired actions. They are as followed:ÃÂÃÂ        Again, these are only our suggestions based on our research and customer feedback. You can fish your Looter Lure in as many ways and you can think of!ÃÂÃÂ     OWNER -ÃÂÃÂ BOBBY VERICELLA      Robert Vericella     Bobby is a lifetime and avid fisherman who was born and raised in Central Illinois.

Feel free to email us at looterlure@gmail.com!       Risks and challenges  Looter Lure is no different than any other hardware startup in that we will be creating a product which consumers will interact with, and with that will come challenges. Looter Lure is a product meant to be used in the harsh environment of the open ocean and various water types, and those environments are never kind Integrity and functionality of the device in its final, production form will be of the utmost importance and we are committed to not shipping a device which is subpar.  Looter Lure is a relatively low-cost hardware product operating in a harsh environment and as such, will require production of higher volumes. In order to meet these production demands, Looter Lure is designed for manufacturability and ease of assembly. Each process required to create Looter Lure will be engineered for scale and repeatability.  We have tried to be very conservative in our estimated delivery date and will make every effort to meet this date. However, when it comes down to it, we hold ourselves to a very high standard and will only ship a product which we are confident that fishermen will find value with and enjoy using over and over again."

HOW IPLOCKED WAS BORN ?     Have you ever had a business idea thinking it would revolutionize the world ? I think we all have !ÃÂÃÂ    In July 2017, while sat on a bench at Harvard University, I received a call from two friends who had just left their jobs to run their own company.  They had a fantastic concept but they had no idea about how to protect it. They came up with a fantastic concept.  However they had no clue about how to protect their idea. ÃÂÃÂ   As a startup, they wanted to raise funds, find partners, and contact administrative bodies, which led them to inadvertently expose their project when they wanted to keep it a secret.  Those two friends stressed that using confidentiality agreements quickly discouraged potential business partners. At the same time, even before turning to the national or international IP institutions, all of the steps that would have been necessary to register their creations seemed complex, time-consuming, and financially burdensome.ÃÂÃÂ   Through this chaos of trying to figure out the usual protecting systems, the idea of IPLocked, a simple, transparent, and cheap protecting alternative, was born.ÃÂÃÂ      THANKS TO IPLOCKED TWO FRIENDS MADE THEIR DREAM COME TRUE: ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>SandyPointÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ, a healthy and responsible fast-food restaurant using local ingredients while also providing wellness coaching thanks to a mobile app.      3.

ÃÂÃÂ   Any photos, videos, paints, concepts, logos, softwares, designs, drawings or books can be protected by the calculation of a digital imprint that allows you to store and transmit information transparently and securely.ÃÂÃÂ    A NEW ECOSYSTEMÃÂÃÂ    At IPLocked we are setting up a new ecosystem, the goal of which is to provide the general public and businesses with an easy-to-use platform for recording, verifying and interacting with intellectual property in general.   OUR CONCEPTÃÂÃÂ    A decentralized certification platform allows creators, startups, inventors, and artists of all types to certify and verify their works. In addition to being able to generate certificates of authenticity, the platform is able to easily create contracts and licenses for their work.   OUR ECONOMIC MODEL   We seek to reduce transaction costs for the trade of IP works by simplifying the authentication process and using the security offered by the blockchain product. Therein, ÃÂÃÂ licenses, payment management and media can be streamlined as well.  The blockchain technology guarantees the integrity of the document. The digital footprint of each document is unique and any modification will lead to the creation of a new hash. This solution is the electronic proof that the author is protected.  We use the concept of blockchain technology and data encryption systems to produce evidence creatorships thanks to timestamping.ÃÂÃÂ          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

CONCLUDING WORDS...MAYBE    A faithful companion   IPLockedÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s new protocol allows the general public and businesses to prove that their creations belong to them based on copyright law. In partnering with IPLocked, an unchangeable certificate can be generated within minutes!  By participating in this project, you help the democratization of creation. It is easier and cheaper for any entrepreneur, artist, student, engineer or others to protect their unique work. Indeed, it is difficult for a startup to have the necessary funds to carry out IP protection for a project where success is uncertain.  IPLocked will not only boost the economy and development but also facilitate creativity between entrepreneurs, creators, startups, inventors, and artists of all types. This energy cluster is the powerful driving force behind a new source of innovation for future generations.   6.

HOW I WANT TO SHAKE UP THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WORLD?    Many startups believe that they do not need intellectual property protection because they do not realize that they have intellectual property assets.   If you are creating value through your business you indeed hold intellectual property.  ÃÂÃÂ   Statistically, nine out of ten startups fail(Forbes). Why ? Startups spread a huge amount of time working  in ÃÂÃÂ boring stuff anesthetize their brains and they overlook key aspects of business process.ÃÂÃÂ Also,  they ran out of cash.ÃÂÃÂ    Protecting their own projects, their ideas or their IP assets should be the first step!ÃÂÃÂ The problem is that intellectual property registration usually much exceeds the budget of rising talents. Protecting your project means not being able to put money elsewhere. Well at least that's what it meant until now.        ÃÂÃÂ 8. ADVANCED TECHNICAL INFORMATIONS    The blockchain guarantees the integrity of the creation   Blockchain guarantees the integrity of the creation. The digital footprint of each creativeÃÂÃÂ work is unique (certification page). Any modification will lead to the creation of a new hash. This solution is the electronic proof that the creatorÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s work is protected.  Using logos and slogans as an example, an ideal blockchain-based database enables a user to access the productÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s digital certificate of authenticity, and this demonstrates where the trademarked product or service came from (its origin) and who owns the rights to the work.  Anyone can trace the product back to its origin and find the certificate of authenticity (verification page), thereby being to distinguish authentic products from counterfeit in market circulation.ÃÂÃÂ          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

ÃÂÃÂ  Are you ready to change the future?ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  Considered a disrupt technology, Blockchain has already drastically changed the deeply ingrained structure and patterns of interaction, since the invention of the Internet in the 1970ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s.   Since its recent emergence, this technology has gradually reformed the running of industries such as car sharing, real estate transactions, banking transactions just to name a few. What does it have to offer to the field of intellectual property and innovation protection?  Applying our blockchain technology to IP management would permit creations to be indelibly and immediately stamped. This is why we provide a dated and time-stamped certificate when entrepreneurs and creators submit their creation or idea.

As far back as I can remember, I have always loved the outdoors and doing things like going camping and fishing. The preparations I would make the day before so that I would have everything needed for a safe adventure the next day always made me so excited. Then after a night of restless sleep dreaming about finally landing the big one I would wake up to the smells of the early morning dew along the waters edge and the sounds of the water rippling along the shoreside which reminded me why it was my favorite place to be. I would unpack my gear and start my adventure hiking along the shore looking for the perfect place to make my first cast. I fished all day long, and I was on cloud nine. This was until I was making my way back to camp.While walking back to camp on this particular trip, I noticed something disturbing along the water. A loon had been caught up in a large amount of discarded fishing line and had died from monofilament fishing line strangulation. Instant sadness came over me because I wasn't aware that something I was having fun doing could cause such a horrible death to a beautiful creature.Fast forward 30 years, the problem of monofilament fishing line entanglements has become a world wide epidemic. Today the amounts of monofilament fishing line sales are at record levels, and the number of entanglement deaths have increased to over 1,000,000 deaths per year. The unfortunate, painful death to these animals needs to be stopped. After doing research, I noticed that the current methods and devices used to strip the fishing line from an anglers fishing reel will often add to the problem and they end up in large piles of fishing line that are left behind. This results in a death sentence to the animals it may entangle. I came up with the Respooler and assembled a team that have helped me to design and produce the first and only hand held fishing line stripper. It has a revolutionary spool winder to collect the fishing line for recycling. The Respooler is an ergonomically designed fishing line stripper that will help assist anglers in recycling their unwanted fishing line for recycling. It will help make sure we put an end to monofilament fishing line entanglements, and if needed the Respooler can also be used as an emergency cell phone power source. We are using our many years of combined product development and marketing sales experience to launch Respooler to the global recreational fishing marketplace.Our company will lanch recycling incentive campaigns to help increase the sales of our new product the Respooler, and at the same time this will help to decrease the number of monofilament fishing line entanglements. We will also start receycling programs to help collect the fishing line for recycling. The recyclined fishing line will then be shipped to us, and we will recycle it to help make more Respoolers. By doing this we will decrease the numbers of entanglements, and help keep the ocean and lakes clean.",1.0,2018-02-27 20:20:51 -0500,Backed 0 projects,KO,KO,KO

ÃÂÃÂ   All car seat manufacturers say that is alright to have some movement when installing the car seat that is because up until the invention of Seat-Tite there was no way to install a car seat without movement. ÃÂÃÂ Seat-Tite guarantees that your child's car seat will be ""secure"" in your car. By using Seat-Tite this allows you to get to the recommended 1 inch of movement or less for your car seat.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ Seat-Tite is patented Worldwide.

I am asking for donations for a ÃÂÃÂ Bee Preservation Program I am working on. With spring quickly approaching I am planning on opening up a private apiary in Western NY and asking for donations to help save the bees. Over the past several years the bee population has been on a steady decline due to colony collapse, disease and, environmental issues. Recently it has been discovered that most bee colonies are dying off because the bees are coming in contact with pesticide and insecticide sprays. It is my hope that by starting an apiary it can help improve the overall population of the bees while increasing pollination rates and helping the survival of other wildlife species as well.ÃÂÃÂ Your contribution will be used to help purchase bees and,ÃÂÃÂ bee supplies for the bees such as wood for hives, frames and bases. ÃÂÃÂ Over 70% of our global crops are pollinated by bees and 90% of the flowering plant species are dependent on bees. I have access to 27 acres of land that was previously used for farming and I would like to plant a flower field/pollen field for the bees on the land. Typically bees will travel no more than 5 miles to collect pollen and water. The available location will allow the bees to have access to water on the property from a small creek and, I am hoping to provide enough pollen so bees will not have to travel far distances and come in contact with pesticides and insecticides. With your contribution I am hopeful that we together can help protect the bees and increase the bee population.      Risks and challenges  Beekeeping is a very risky thing to do.  Honeybees can be affected by low pollen/nectar, cold weather, rain and, illness. Despite the best care colony collapse can still occur. While we cannot guarantee success I can assure you there will be open communication and updates on our progress.  One of my biggest concerns is being unable to fulfill the honey rewards, I have given the bees ample time to produce enough honey for rewards."

We've designed it once, built it, redesigned it and had upgrades made. The problem with it being our first app is that it's a learning experience and we're now close to the end of our budget. The app's free for everyone and the feedback we've had so far is positive. Along the way we've picked up constructive criticism which we want to include in an upgrade to make the app fully functional. We want to enhance the tipping advice, increasing accuracy. Currently we have a tipping percentage for each country which is included in our algorithm. These tipping percentages are then used to determine a tip, based on the level of service that the user receives and the bill amount. It's quick easy and can help people navigate the problems of cultural differences in tipping.ÃÂÃÂ   Whilst tipping is a divisive topic, it is something that a lot of people rely on in many countries across the world. However, it's also something that can cause offence in other places. So we just want to help people get it right.ÃÂÃÂ   Currently we offer four services, which are restaurant, bar, taxi and porter tipping. We'd like to expand this to include other options, such as housekeeping and hairdresser services.ÃÂÃÂ   There are a few issues with the user experience of the app which we really need to address to ensure users find it easy to navigate and use.ÃÂÃÂ   We also have a mini travel guide in the app, which needs to be expanded. This requires research and then implementation. We want to provide the user with information such as emergency numbers for the country, local company links and any important information they might need for their travels. Currently the travel guide offers a few language tips and facts about the country they're in, but it needs to be made more comprehensive.ÃÂÃÂ   With the money we are hoping to raise, we'd also like to pay for another year of hosting (to keep us online) and to pay for some advertising to help reach potential users of the app.ÃÂÃÂ   We feel that the initial feedback and first year of the app being live has provided us with enough proof of concept to continue should we be able to raise the required funds to keep us online.ÃÂÃÂ   Going forward, we would like to raise awareness of dining culture across the world. There are so many cultural differences between nations and it's easy to offend accidentally. Whilst this may not bother some people, it's best avoided!ÃÂÃÂ   We collect non sensitive data from users, such as costs of meals in various locations and amount tipped in certain areas, which we are hoping to be able to utilise to provide a key insight into tipping cultures around the world. You could be part of that! :)  Thanks for reading!      Risks and challenges  The app is currently performing modestly across iOS and Android, but to take it to the next level we need to be able to make the changes mentioned above. We have a developer in-place, ready to make the changes and we don't foresee any issues with being able to get the app developed to where we need it to be. The main challenge comes with the advertisement and marketing of the app. On a small budget we need to be able to reach out to the right people to help us promote the app effectively. We have a long PR list which we plan to utilise to help ensure we get the most bang for our buck!"

Every day people spend hours trying to measure their fitness levels, compute their financial status, maintain their professional goals and make notes of hundreds and thousands of concerns, events or goals. Scribbling these thoughts and numbers on a piece of paper is often not enough to help them achieve the desired goals.ÃÂÃÂ   We joined hands to convert these thoughts into reality. ÃÂÃÂ With your help and support from Kickstarter, we want to bring a paperless solution, that not only will be easy to use, but also will organize information such that users can track their progress and chase their goals with much higher efficiency.ÃÂÃÂ   Boostu360 offers several templates for various different purposes. Users trying to lose weight can track their progress every single day along with their fitness partner(s). No more do they not have to start over several times a year due to lack of tracking. They can discontinue and get back on track anytime they want. Similarly, users can track their blood pressure several times a day and if required, take medicines and keep a record of every action and blood pressure levels. Being healthy will become so much easier.ÃÂÃÂ        Users can just feed in the data they measure into these templates and let the tool compute the results. It will effectively indicate how close is the user to the desired goals. No more worries of when and how to reach the goals. Our templates will take care of all calculations and present the information to the users in the most efficient way.ÃÂÃÂ        People often have a tough time planning their financial freedom, selecting the most suited loan option for home, education or vehicle loan purposes. Our templates will help them put all information in a clear way to be able to make the best decision according to their needs. Which loan interest, down payment or loan term will give the best return over a period of several years, will be very easy to decide.ÃÂÃÂ        There are several other templates for specific purposes that we created to help our users become more efficient. They can maintain their information, track activities and analyze their performances over time without worrying about lost data of the past. These templates are designed for plug &amp; play usage, so there is absolutely nothing to setup or configure. Download the file and use it, and that too FREE of cost.ÃÂÃÂ    The later versions of the templates will also include Artificial Intelligence to be able to inform the users about the positives and negatives related to the progress tracked. In some cases, the templates will predict the short term future events and warn the users of the same, so they can take appropriate measures to stay in control of their health, finances, schedules or other relevant activities.ÃÂÃÂ     The big plans   This project is planned to empower as many users on this planet as it can. We have already made several templates available for download on the website. The templates are easy to use and are designed for plug &amp; play usage so anyone can just browse the website and download the templates and start using it without any setup or configurations. Some files (seemingly complicated) have very clear and concise instructions to use it. The goal is to make more and more people use these templates and solve their day-to-day problems more efficiently. They can save several hours every week with these templates. There will be so many more templates available by the end of August 2019.ÃÂÃÂ   We intend to offer these templates at FREE of cost to everyone and help them become more productive not only at a professional level, but also at a personal level. We would like to empower our users to solve every small and big problems using a customized template. We are going to market these solutions through our users and visitors on site to have the maximum spread and visibility. People will be able to present these templates as gifts to their friends and families to make each other more productive and use the saved time for each other or chasing something more desirable.ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ With Artificial Intelligence solutions on their way, the templates are set to make a much greater impact. By the first quarter of 2020, the AI powered templates will be a revolution for monitoring health records, managing financial possibilities and managing daily activities.ÃÂÃÂ     Why this project? ÃÂÃÂ   After helping several professionals and individuals solve these day-to-day problems of tracking and computing information, we joined hands to make this available for everyone. We realized our skills could be useful for the society at a much larger scale and here we are with this project trying to make an impact. We want people to focus on their goals rather than worrying about whether or not they will be able to achieve them. This project is an attempt to empower everyone with the ability to save time and become more efficient. And all this is done paperless! If successful, we will save hundreds of thousands of paper per year. With the growing risk of losing the green planet, this is our step towards helping our planet and its people. ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ We believe, this is all possible with your help and support from Kickstarter. The world is changing, let's be on the positive side of change, together!ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  We have taken care of the technical perspective and are motivated enough to make this solution available to a huge number of users. But, the financial restrictions and the marketing strategy are the two major risk areas for us. If we do not achieve our financial goal, our plan will shift focus and we will not be able to create the impact we desire. The marketing strategy also plays a vital role and if we do not execute the actions as planned, there will be definite lack of awareness and the impact will again be sacrificed. But we are ready to face the challenges with the possibility to overcome them with the funding we hope to achieve via Kickstarter."

ÃÂÃÂ        Our new type of VTOL Aircraft is expected to have lower production costs compared to conventional helicopters, while being easier to control, and cheaper to operate and maintain. In addition, this new type of Aircraft will be able to fly at speeds of up to 0.83 Mach, cruise at altitudes of up to 36,000 feet, and ÃÂÃÂ travel for up to 7,000 miles in one trip, which is not attainable by any of the currently in-use civilian VTOL Aircraft. Of course, we are not accounting here for few VTOL Aircraft used by the Army, as they have several operational challenges making them incompatible for civilian applications.  Our Technology  Due to the current high market demand for an Aircraft that can take off and land vertically like a helicopter, but can still go as fast, as high, and as far as a winged aircraft can go, several companies have been proposing various types of Aircraft that can do this. However, as all the proposed designs are based on modifications in already in-use technology, none of them provided the ideal solution for this quest, with most development projects being discontinued.       On the contrary, our proposed VTOL Aircraft will employ an innovative Compact Propeller to lift the aircraft. Our breakthrough compact propeller uses a novel low angle-of-attack propellers' layout that enables providing high disk loading (up to 250 pounds per foot square), paired with high hover lift efficiency (up to 20 pounds per horse power). This will enable positioning the compact propellers in ducts in the central part of the aircraftÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s fuselage, which will enable designing the aircraftÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s power train with less moving parts, when compared to a conventional helicopterÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s power train. This ÃÂÃÂ will make our VTOL Aircraft cheaper to produce and maintain, and less prone to accidents due to component failure. This will also allow for operating the aircraft at relatively higher speeds and altitudes, while avoiding the adverse effect of any surrounding wind that maybe encountered during the flight.       As our technology includes several IP information that is not covered by patent applications yet, we are not in a position to freely discus it openly as this will be considered public disclosure, which will limit our ability to protect it with patents later on.ÃÂÃÂ        Our Products  An ideal VTOL aircraftÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s propeller would be a propeller providing relatively high hover lift efficiency, preferably more than 15 pounds per horsepower, and high disk loading, preferably more than 200 pounds per square foot, to enable reducing the diameter of the propellerÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s rotor, which will provide more flexibility in the VTOL aircraft design. Such propellerÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s performance parameters can only be provided by using a propeller having a number of low angle-of-attack blades positioned in close proximity to one another.       However, due to the negative effect the low angle-of-attack blades have on the potential flow and pressure distribution of the working air at the leading edges of one another, so they need to be positioned apart from each other, resulting in a relatively low disk loading whenever low angle-of-attack blades are employed.  To overcome this challenge, our innovative technology provides a compact lift-generating propeller design that enables positioning the low angle-of-attack blades in close proximity to one another, while modifying the potential flow and the pressure distribution of the working fluid around the leading edges of the propeller blades to maximum the efficiency.       The feasibility of our technology was successfully assessed using the reputable Multi-Element Airfoil CFD Analysis tool developed by Hanley innovations, which is currently used by NASA and several other Aeronautical Research Centers.  Based on this assessment, our technology will enable the production of lift-generating Propellers providing a high hover lift efficiency of up to 20 pounds per horsepower, and high disk loading of up to 250 pounds per foot square. ÃÂÃÂ   These unique performance characteristics will enable decreasing the size of the lift-force generating propellers so that they can be ducted and placed in the middle part of the Aircraft's fuselage, which will enable flying the Aircraft at speeds of up to 0.83 Mach, and at altitudes of up to 36,000 feet, while providing marked reduction in the Aircraft's rate of fuel consumption.  Competitive Advantages  Once the development of our technology is complete, it will enable producing quieter Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) Aircraft that are cheaper to produce and maintain, safer and easier to operate, and can fly at higher speeds and altitudes. Accordingly, once fully developed, it is expected to find application in all future VTOL Aircraft, and to boost the worldwide production in this sector.  The competitive advantages of our technology are as follows:   ÃÂÃÂ  Exceptional Fuel Saving Potentials:  Based on provisional performance calculations, employing the Compact propeller Technology within an aircraft will provide between 30-40% reductions in the aircraftÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s rate of fuel consumption. This will decrease the aircraftÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s operating costs, and extend its operating range, making it desirable for small and medium sized aircraft operators to use in their fleets.    ÃÂÃÂ  Vertical Take-off and Landing Super Plane:  Employing the Compact propeller Technology within an aircraft will enable it to take-off and land vertically, while maintaining all the competitive advantages a conventional winged aircraft has, i.e. being safer to fly and quieter to operate, can fly at speeds of up to 0.83 Mach, can cruise at altitudes of up to 36,000 feet, and can travel non-stop for up to 7,000 miles.    ÃÂÃÂ  Compatibility with ÃÂÃÂ Current Technologies:  Employing our technology in an already in-production aircraft model will necessitate minimal modifications to the aircraft design, so it can be adapted by aircraft manufacturers in their production lines at a minimal cost. This will also be justified by the expected high market demand for the Aircraft employing this technology.    ÃÂÃÂ  High Durability and Reliability:  Due to the simplicity of the design, rigidity of the structure, and the minimal number of moving parts within the Compact Propeller power train, we believe that Compact Propellers will be highly reliable with a service life similar to, or exceeding, that of other conventional aircraft power train parts.   Our MarketÃÂÃÂ   Once fully developed and introduced to the market, our innovative technology is predicted to answer the quest for an Aircraft that combines the advantages of Helicopters with those of winged Aircraft. So, in addition to being able to take-off and land vertically and to hover for extended time in the air, they will be able to go as fast as 640 mph (0.83 Mach), and to operate at altitudes up to 36,000 feet, will be cheaper to build, maintain and operate, easier to fly, and less prone to accidents due to pilot error or mechanical failure. These competitive advantages will enable building Aircraft that is better suited for many military and civilian applications.ÃÂÃÂ        Accordingly, once fully developed and introduced to the market, it is expected to find wide scale application in both the Helicopter Market and the Business Aircraft Market.   Helicopter Market:  Due their ability to take-off and land vertically, almost anywhere, without the need for a runway; their ability to fly lower and slower than airplanes or even hover for extended time in the air; their ability to carry payloads internally or externally via slings or winches; and their ability to reduce the travel time from one point to another while being able to go to places where no other means of transportation can go, Helicopters find wide scale application in many fields.ÃÂÃÂ   These markets include: military defense and surveillance; offshore oil and gas platforms and exploration; health emergency and medical services; law enforcement; VIP transport; and others, with over 55,000 Helicopters being currently in use worldwide, and with over 1,200 Helicopters being added annually to the civilian working fleets with a market value of over $1 billion.  As mentioned herein above, as our proposed new type of VTOL Aircraft combines the competitive advantages of Helicopters with those of winged Aircraft, it is expected to eat up a big portion of the Helicopters market share as it will provide Helicopter customers with a VTOL aircraft that is cheaper to buy, maintain and operate; easier to fly; can fly faster; and provides the safety and comfort of a winged aircraft. Accordingly, this proposed new type of VTOL Aircraft is expected to get more than 70% of the current Helicopters market share, with more than 1,400 units produced annually and with a net revenue of over $15 Billion/year.ÃÂÃÂ    Business jet Market:  Business Jet Aircraft are widely used worldwide as they are cost effective and a safe mode of travel. The ability to conduct business privately during flights, on-demand flight scheduling, reduced travel time and direct access to company sites are major benefits of these Aircraft.ÃÂÃÂ   On 1 April 2017, there were 22,368 business jets in the worldwide fleet. For the decade starting in 2017, Aviation Week predicts 11,346 deliveries of business aircraft (jets or not) valued at $250.1 billion, with a fleet growing from 31,864 aircraft to 36,702 aircraft (64% in North America): 4,838 more at an average annual growth rate of 1.6%, with 5,835 retirements.  Based on the competitive advantages of our new type of VTOL Aircraft, it is expected to eat up a portion of the Business Aircraft market share, as it will provide businessmen with an Aircraft that has all the advantages a conventional Business Aircraft has while being able to take-off and land vertically almost anywhere, which will relieve businessmen from the need to commute to a nearby airport to get on an Aircraft. Accordingly, this proposed new type of VTOL Aircraft is expected to get more than 30% of the current Business Aircraft market share, with more than 300 units produced annually and with a net revenue of over $7 Billion/year.ÃÂÃÂ        We believe our technology will boost worldwide production of Aircraft in these two sectors, as current Helicopter and Business Aircraft customers will tend to replace their fleets with safer, faster, and quieter VTOL Aircraft employing our proposed technology.  Research and Development Plan  The R&amp;D work that needs to be done before this technology can be employed in future Vertical Take-off and Landing Aircraft is divided into three phases:   Phase I : during which technology feasibility will be conclusively assessed. The work performed in this phase will include:  ÃÂÃÂ· Designing and building a proof-of-concept prototype for the ÃÂÃÂ lift generating mechanism that will enable the production of the above mentioned new type of VTOL Aircraft.  ÃÂÃÂ· Preparing and submitting U.S. &amp; PCT Patent applications.   Phase II:  during which an unmanned VTOL aircraft model employing this technology will be built and tested, while securing our IP rights in other countries.   Phase III:  during which a marketing campaign, aiming at licensing the technology to major Helicopter and Business jet aircraft manufacturers, will be executed.  Before launching this crowdfunding campaign we tried several funding routes, with all funding parties requesting a working prototype for the technology before investing in it.ÃÂÃÂ   We also submitted a proposal to the NSF through their Seed Fund program,  https://seedfund.nsf.gov/ . Although our proposal received positive technical reviews from the NSF experts, which they shared with us, the proposal was declined mostly due to funding unavailability.  Accordingly, we are looking for your support to fund Phase I of this R&amp;D endeavor, after which we will be able to secure future funding from private sector investors.ÃÂÃÂ   Our CompanyÃÂÃÂ        Our company is currently located in the Technology Incubator of North Carolina State University (NCSU), which gives us direct access to the NCSU research community, facilities, and resources, from which we will recruit our consultants and workforce. For more information about our company please visit our website at  www.novoaerotech.com/.ÃÂÃÂ        Risks and challenges  The main challenge we have is securing the funding needed to build and test a proof-of-concept prototype for this technology. Although the feasibility of our technology was successfully assessed using the Multi-Element Airfoil CFD Analysis tool, developed by ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Hanley innovationsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ, which is currently used by NASA and several other Aeronautical Research Centers, a proof-of-concept prototype needs to be built and tested for the conclusive assessment of the potentials of this technology.  The next challenge will be to secure funding from the private sector to further develop the technology, secure its IP rights, and market it. To overcome this challenge, we plan on seeking different routes to secure needed funding, such as Equity Crowdfunding and Angel Investors, once the proof-of-concept prototype is built and tested. Please support us on this endeavor and share this crowdfunding campaign with family and friends to enable us to get this unique technology out to the market in the near future."

ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>ElectrosmogÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ describes the electromagnetic waves surrounding us in our environment. Electric and magnetic fields are invisible areas of energy (also called radiation).  At present, electromagnetic radiation, or electrosmog has become a problem of great concern to international public opinion .  As you sit watching TV, not only are there visible light waves from the TV striking your eyes, but also radio waves, transmitting from a nearby station, and microwaves carrying cellphone calls and text messages, and waves from your neighborÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s WiFi, and GPS units in the cars driving by.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   There is a chaos of waves from all across the spectrum passing through your room right now.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ      Electromagnetic Spectrum    The level of exposure to electrosmog that is harmful remains highly debated. However, numerous studies have provided us with sufficient data to support the conclusion that electrosmog  is  harmful. Additionally, many of these studies suggest that currently established limits for exposure are insufficient. Electromagnetic radiation may lead to the changes in physiological indices, genetic effects, and immune function and affect the health and immune function in people. Research has shown a direct correlation between exposure to electromagnetic radiation and cancer. Increased risk of brain, vestibular nerve and salivary gland tumors are associated with mobile phone use, or prolonged exposure to high intensity radio frequencies  Very few people feel the presence of electrosmog. It is invisible and its effects subtle. But now there are more and more sufferers, which react to high-frequency radiation, primarily, with physical pains. In almost all cases, the sensitivity begins with a dull feeling in the head, dizziness and lack of concentration. If you take the time to be aware of how you feel in different environments, however, you may see a correlation between how much youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re exposed and how you feel. Take the time, for example, to see how you feel over a period of time in a big city (high levels of exposure) versus how you feel in the country away from cell towers, Wi-Fi, high tension lines, and other sources of electrosmog.  The types of electrosmog which are particularly harmful are the high-frequency radiation fields created by cellular and cordless phones, cellular phone towers, Wi-Fi, and microwaves. Besides all this, what to think about the newly developed 5G cellular network? The electric field in the air will go from 6V/m to 61V/m, we will literally be surrounded by millimeter and submillimeter wave frequencies, and what are the consequences?     Also  on the  horizontal  plane  you  can see  significant  differences  in Volt/m,  caused  from the lobes of radiation of all the various antennas  fixed  on  the support pole    While of course you canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t see electrosmog, there are some simple things you can take into account when considering how much you are exposed. For example, do I live or work near a cell phone tower, power station, or high voltage lines? What devices do I have in my house? Do I have Wi-Fi, cordless phones, baby monitors, etc.? Do I use a microwave oven?  ÃÂÃÂ  What is   SNIFFER ÃÂÃÂ®  ? ÃÂÃÂ          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Even though this device will not solve the problem of harmful radiation in your environment, it will however show you exactly where in your home or workplace you can find major concentrations of electromagnetic radiation. It is disturbing to see that only moving a few meters, high concentrations of radiation can suddenly disappear. This device allows you for example to discover if your microwave is leaking radiation because of a faulty door seal, to detect the presence of bugs, microspyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s or hidden video cameraÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s in your home or workplace, or it gives you the opportunity to re-arrange the furniture in your home, avoiding the continuous exposure to toxic radiation when you are sitting on the couch when watching tv, or to change the position of the beds in your childrenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s bedroom or the head end of your own bed, to protect their and your health and for a better nightÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s sleep, so you can feel rested and relaxed when you wake up.  Despite its small size, it has been designed taking advantage of the high sensitivity of the sensor, which is able to detect very weak signals which are amplified through a wideband monolithic amplifier with high dynamic range, capable of managing a frequency range up to 8GHz. This signal, once amplified will pass through a special circuit and converted into a visual and audible signal, i.e. a LED and a buzzer, with an intermittent variable according to the distance and the intensity of the detected signal.  We created two types of Sniffer; the small one, suitable for all, and the more sophisticated one. These two SNIFFERS, both portable, though performing the same functions, have different characteristics.  ÃÂÃÂ   SNIFFERÃÂÃÂ®  ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ This Sniffer Is cylindrical, with the size of a key ring, and is powered by a 12 volt battery (not rechargeable). Its reception sensitivity is invariable and it is able to detect signals ranging from 100 MHz up to 8 GHz, at distances from 50 cm up to about 2 meters from, for example, cell phones, bugs, video cameras, routers, and wireless connections. Regarding the signals from radio towers and cell towers, although the simple Sniffer is not equipped with a sensitivity adjustment function, it is able to identify the exact location of major concentrations of radio frequencies.  The signal detected by the sensor will be amplified and modulated, therefore depending on the amplitude of the signal, the Led will be activated.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        The material of which the Sniffer is made (aerospace aluminum), provides a perfect shield for both the internal circuit and the external interference signals, but not for the signals that are detected by the sensor through a small internal antenna, but shielded from the circuit.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ      It is powered by a 12V battery, not rechargeable, included in the kit     The case is entirely made and refinished in aerospace aluminum and brass, machining on the CNC from solid  ÃÂÃÂ   SNIFFER ÃÂÃÂ® PRO  ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ The Sniffer PRO Is more sophisticated, besides having a sensitivity adjustment function, is equipped with an external antenna. It is also possible to mount other types of antennas , like the logarithmic models, with very high sensitivity.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        It is able to intercept even the weakest signals and operating the sensitivity potentiometer ÃÂÃÂ it is possible to detect signals over a distance of more than 10 meters (cell phones, bugs, video cameras, routers, and wireless connections), Regarding radio towers and cell towers, given its sensitivity, the Sniffer can inspect large areas and identify the locations where the antenna lobes release the highest RF concentrations.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ When it detects a signal, depending on the intensity, a bar LED lights up, and when the detected signal reaches its maximum amplitude, an intermittent acoustic signal is activated.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        The material of which the   SNIFFER    ÃÂÃÂ®   PRO   is made (aerospace aluminum) provides a perfect shield for both the internal circuit and the external interference signals.ÃÂÃÂ           It is powered by a lithium battery, rechargeable through the network or the computer; the kit includes the antenna, a network transformer and USB cable.

I started this journey back in August 2015 as all good business ideas start with some mates over a pint.I first saw an electric skateboard when I was on holiday in Surfers Paradise down the East coast of Australia. I loved them and from that point on I knew I wanted to start my own business and get involved in this awesome industry.I did a ton of research and bought about 5 electric skateboards from different companies. There wasnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t a lot out there really, just a few companies with expensive eboards and a lot of companies with really cheap eboards.I read up online on the big brands out there and what was on offer. I tested the hell out of all the boards I bought and came up with these conclusionsIf you want a quality eboard you need to spend well over ÃÂÃÂ£1200. (plus import costs and shipping)Any eboard less than this was generally poor quality and did not live up to the claimed mileage and speed.ThereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s lots of companies out there outside the UK and EU but not many at all right here.I knew what I had to do. If I wanted to stand out in the market, I would need to source eboards to retail for between ÃÂÃÂ£500 and ÃÂÃÂ£900 whilst still maintaining the quality of the more expensive eboards.

Swap between Rough Stuff Wheels and road wheels  85A hardness - smooth ride and hardwearing  110mm diameter - cruise over lumps and bumps  Convex design for less resistance on smooth and more grip on rough terrainÃÂÃÂ   Polyurethane material- no punctures or hassleÃÂÃÂ           ÃÂÃÂ          Each set of Rough Stuff Wheels comes with 2 x Sprockets/Pulley Wheels to mount on to a standard 35mm bearing. Each Pulley has 40 teeth.ÃÂÃÂ          The convex design allows for less rolling resistance on flat, with the Rough Stuff Wheel running in the centre 20mm. When you take to rougher stuff the rest of the wheel comes in to play offering superior grip.       ÃÂÃÂ          Advanced Flexible Battery Case Design   Rides just like a normal longboard with a flexible deck. Better weight distribution, more stable, smoother and grounded ride  Protected, bash proof, dust proof and water resistant design  Removable battery case and easy connectors  'Bolt-on' designÃÂÃÂ to change decks with minimal hassle  On-board LED battery level display  USB output for charging any tech and the wireless controller  Slim design for greater ground clearance and sleek look          ÃÂÃÂ          Deck Choice  Bamboo Deck  Symmetrical rounded shape with central cutouts for more torsional flex and a more grounded ride. Made from several bamboo layers this deck is flexible and responsive.  Carbon Composite Deck  This smooth responsive deck is the perfect partner to the Rough Stuff wheel.	Made from 7 plys of premium Canadian maple fused with a multi layer carbon fibre matrix providing unrivalled ride and control. Toe heel concave to lock your feet for stability while the flexible cambered deck soaks up bumps at any speed.ÃÂÃÂ          How it works  The subtle positive camber when compressed by the riders weight tensions the mono directional fibres of the carbon matrix producing a smooth and progressive flex that absorbs larger bumps and shocks like the springs of a car.ÃÂÃÂ   X tow configuration of carbon fibre in the nose and tail ensures tight responsive turning and control at speed.ÃÂÃÂ   Then combine these ultra thin layers of carbon fibre with premium Canadian rock maple laminate and its high density absorbs higher frequency harmonic vibration for a less fatiguing ride. Many solid eboard decks, especially with hub motors are a real bone shaker to ride.  Level riding technology. This deck rides flat whether youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re 60kg or 120kg as Carbon Fibre can only stretch to 110% of its original length.  Carbon Composite Deck vs Full Carbon  Carbon fibre is very very strong under tension. So it allows flex but adds a great amount of strength to a deck when used in conjunction with layers of maple. So our Carbon Flex-E has a layer of Carbon Fibre on its underside with cross strands running underneath this.  A full Carbon deck cannot flex at all as as soon as you add a camber or concave the structure becomes rigid and can only snap, not flex.  Ever seen a picture of a Carbon Fibre bicycle which has snapped? Carbon Fibre cannot resist impact very well at all. Carbon fibre once set in epoxy resin cannot be repaired. Its strength lies in its tensile strength. The Carbon Flex-Eboard adds a carbon layer to save weight and add a whole new dimension of awesomeness.         ÃÂÃÂ Missed out on the Kickstarter?

This mode reduces the top speed to just below half of maximum. Run in to trouble or want to jump off? At 10mph youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be perfectly safe. Top Speed in Fun Mode: 10mph (16km/h)   Thrill Mode   When youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re ready to take things to the next level. Greater acceleration and up to the maximum speed for real adrenaline action. Top speed in Thrill Mode: 22mph (35km/h)   Cruise Mode   With a click of the hand controller, stay at any speed with no need to use the controller, simply brake to deactivate. Easy to use and saves energy, increasing range.   ÃÂÃÂ          ÃÂÃÂ        HUB VS BELT DRIVEÃÂÃÂ   A belt driven eboard has the motor mounted outside the motor with a belt connecting the motor and wheel with a sprocket.  A hub motor has the motor mounted inside the wheel with no need for a belt.ÃÂÃÂ   Belt Drive  Our belt drive system allows for interchangeable wheels and of course a full polyurethane wheel for a more comfortable ride and greater customisation.ÃÂÃÂ   The 3:1 gear ratio offers so much more torque than a hub motor of the same power.ÃÂÃÂ Faster acceleration, better hill climbing ability and power over rough terrain where hub motors are left in the Flex-Eboard's dust.         Hub Drive  With just a few mm of Polyurethane separating the motor and the riding surface, hub motors don't provide a very comfortable ride on anything but the smoothest of roads.  Yep, we admit, hub motors are more discreet and look great.  If you prefer the look of a hub motor then thats fine, but if you prefer more torque, acceleration and complete customisation then belt drive is the way forward.         In each Flex-Eboard box you will find:   A Flex-Eboard with the deck of your choice  A set of 4 Rough Stuff Wheels on the Eboard  A set of 4 Road Wheels  Wireless Remote Control  Certified Adaptor and Plug (with UK, European or US plug)  USB to micro USB Cable  Eboard spanner and Allen Key  Carry Bag  Full instruction Manual          Timeline         Our Story  Why we are different  Slick Revolution have been designing and retailing electric skateboards in the European market place for just over 2 years.ÃÂÃÂ We are electric longboardÃÂÃÂ geeks. ThereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s just nothing quite like them and thereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s nothing quite like ours.ÃÂÃÂ   We have our production line set up to go in to manufacture as soon as the kickstarter project reaches its target. We have a great relationship with our manufacturers in China as well as feet on the ground over there. Our internal PCBÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s, wireless control and technical aspects have all been tested extensively, not only by our team but you guys, our awesome customers in our current range of eboards.ÃÂÃÂ   We have feedback from all of our customers which have led us to this design. Skaters, long boarders and eboarders have all chipped in to create exactly what the eboard market is missing.  The new elements of the new design are aesthetic and practical and so itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a re-design of a proven model essentially.Many Kickstarter projects (particulary some US eboard ones) do succeed and reach their target but very often do not come to fruition as those running the campaign have very little manufacturing knowledge. So many Kickstarters fall down at this last hurdle with no prior knowledge of where to go at this point.  Why the Flex-Eboard is different  Lots ofÃÂÃÂ eboard manufacturersÃÂÃÂ are moving towards integrated battery decks which is fine, but that's where the Flex-Eboard is different.An integrated battery means you lose the flexibility of the deck, plus youÃÂÃÂ are stuck with one deck design.ÃÂÃÂ   Plus we have chosen not to move to Hub motors for a few reasons.   They have poor torque whereas the Flex-Eboard is geared up in a 3:1 ratio.  They have a tiny thickness of PU wheel on the outside of the hub motor. This reduces the ride to a bone shaking experience on anything but a perfect surface.  Our customers can upgrade motors in the future when more powerful ones become available. No need for a whole new expensive hub motor.ÃÂÃÂ    Our innovative battery case is flexible and 'bolt-on' style meaning you have a flexible more grounded ride and you aren't tied to a single design. It's really easy to swap the deck in the future and means that customisation is endless.  We've also developed Rough Stuff polyurethane wheels which are far more suitable for UK and European roads. We're not calling them 'Off-Road' wheels as our aim was to give a more comfortable ride on Multi-Terrain. Which for most people is poor quality tarmac and light gravel paths. We also wanted to offer the choice, so designed our wheels to fit a standard 35mm bearing and 6 prong sprocket so it can fit ABEC 11 Flywheels and many other brands too.ÃÂÃÂ   To date we have sold over 500 electric longboardsÃÂÃÂ and have our electronics perfected. So no teething problems or connection issues to worry about with our new design. We have it tested, re-tested and tested it again. Not on a bench in a workshop but by all of our current customers riding all over the world.  Why we need your helpÃÂÃÂ   In all manufacturing, there are discounts for larger quantities. With guaranteed orders at these quantities, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be able to keep the price low and create supply chains to allow us to get the Flex-Eboard to customers around the world. We have finalised the Flex-Eboard design, formed partnerships and have a solid production plan in place. To ramp up production we need your help to pay for expensive moulds in order to produce on a mass scale. Then we can increase production and bring the costs down.ÃÂÃÂ   Thank you for all your support. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re looking forward to seeing Flex-Eboard being ridden all around the world. ÃÂÃÂ         Stretch Goals  Once our kickstarter target of ÃÂÃÂ£10,00 has been met, these are our stretch goals. Reach these and we will be able to offer the following:       ÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ    SAFETY  The Flex-Eboard is an electric skateboard. You should learn at slow speeds in Fun mode before moving to Thrill Mode. Always wear a helmet and your personal protective gear in case anything happens. Ride within your limits and read our full instruction manual before using the Flex-Eboard.ÃÂÃÂ   LEGALITY  Laws and regulations regarding electric vehicles, and electric skateboards, vary by country, state, county, and municipality, so please check the local legal status of this product before you ride it.  FAQ's   Q: I am not livingÃÂÃÂ in the UK, can I buy a Flex-Eboard?   A: We ship to the UK, EU Countries and the US. Check each pledge for the total shipping costs.ÃÂÃÂ    Q:ÃÂÃÂ Can I use normal road style wheels on the Flex-Eboard?   A: Yep, it's compatible with both flat road and our Rough Stuff Wheels. The sprockets mounts on to 35mm bearings and can fit on ABEC 11 Flywheels.   Q: Can I mount the Rough Stuff Wheels on another eboard or board?   A: Absolutely. Each set of Rough Stuff wheels comes with a 2 drive sprockets to mount on a standard 35mm bearing, as well as 2 belt drive covers.   Q: Does my Flex-Eboard come with a warranty?   A: Each Flex-Eboard comes with a 12 month warranty against manufacturers defects. For full Warranty information check out our Warranty section at www.slickrevolution.co.uk   Q: Is the Flex-Eboard waterproof?   A: It's water resistant which means that you can ride on wet ground, however if water is splashing up then thats too wet. 5 minutes of drizzle to get home will be ok too. It is electrical at the end of the day so just be careful near water.ÃÂÃÂ    Q: What could I do if my Flex-E runs out of battery?   A: Just like a normal longboard or skateboard you can ride without power. There is some slight resistance from the motors but it isn't too much at all.   Q: Can I bring the Flex-Eboard on aeroplanes or check-in?   A: Since ÃÂÃÂ  the recent issues with Hoverboards and Samsung Galaxy Note 7's most airlines are very cautious and as a general rule most will not allow batteries above 100Wh. The Flex-Eboard's batteries are 194Wh.ÃÂÃÂ    Q: What is the return policy ?   A: Don't worry! We get you here! We have 14-Day Satisfaction Guaranteed.ÃÂÃÂ We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchases. Orders are fully refundable at any time prior to shipping. If youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re not happy with the product within 14 days, simply return it back to us for a full refund. *Items returned for refund must be returned within 14ÃÂÃÂ days from delivery.ÃÂÃÂ   Under no circumstances will we issue refunds after 14ÃÂÃÂ days of delivery.*Customers are responsible for shipping costs for all return claims and are subject to restocking fee of 20% if the eboard has been ridden or are not in store bought condition with packaging in new, sellable form.   Q: What does the 12 month Warranty cover?   A: Our twelve month warranty covers all manufacturers defects. If you have a problem with your Flex-eboard due to a manufacturers defect we will arrange pickup for free and repair the eboard as soon as we can within the UK, then send it back out to you. For other countries we will send out spare parts based on a diagnosis of the issue. We also offer a repair service for eboards which are damaged or broken due to user negligence or accidents.   Q: What is the maximum user weight of the Flex-Eboard?   A: 120kg or 265lbs is our recommended maximum user weight.ÃÂÃÂ    Q: ÃÂÃÂ I'm closer to the top end of the weight limit, will I get the same performance?   A: Our performance spec's are based on an 80kg rider on smooth tarmac. If you weight heavier than this you won't achieve the same ranges or quite touch the top speed however with the torque of the 2 x 1200W motors riders up to 120kg won't be far off.ÃÂÃÂ    Q: I'm new to Kickstarter, what are the stretch goals?   A: Once we have reached our goal of ÃÂÃÂ£10,000, the project has succeeded and production will begin. The stretch goals are further targets which would allow us further production of Rough Stuff Wheel colour options at ÃÂÃÂ£50,000 and a new style controller at ÃÂÃÂ£75,000. We also have an exciting option at ÃÂÃÂ£250,000. If we are lucky enough to reach that goal we will of course release more details about it.ÃÂÃÂ    Q: Where are the Flex-Eboards shipping from?   A: The Flex-Eboard is manufactured in China after which they will be shipped to the UK. After further quality control checks by our team they will then be shipped to you, our awesome backers! Once they arrive in the UK shipping to the US and Europe will take around 2 weeks.ÃÂÃÂ    Q: Once I have backed the Flex-Eboard, what happens then?   A: No money will leave your account until we have reached our goal and the project has therefore succeeded. We will keep you updated about production, manufacturing, shipping and all the important things that you want to know, right here on this page.   Q: The kickstarter has reached its goal, now what happens?   A: Funding continues above 100% and we aim to reach the stretch goals at ÃÂÃÂ£50k ÃÂÃÂ£75k and ÃÂÃÂ£250k. Keep backing us for more releases! ÃÂÃÂ     Q: What if theres a delay in production?   A: We have built in to our predicted shipping time, buffer periods to allow for any delay at every stage from manufacture of the moulds to shipping. If however there is a delay we will notify you immediately and keep you well up to date on any change in the timescale.  Missed out on the kickstarter?

This product, Crystal Orb, will be the first application in aquarium; more exciting inventions will follow.",1.0,2017-02-21 00:17:27 -0500,Backed 0 projects,KO,KO,"New materials have been changing our lives. Countless innovations already make daily life easier: silicone bakeware, ceramic knives, corian chopping boards, etc.. Finding fresh applications for a new material is as exciting as inventing it.  Crystal Orb is the first application of this patented nanomaterial ( US 9574136 B2 ) in ornamental culture.  The unique water clarifying features of Crystal Orb will benefit hobbyists, culturists and aquarium owners.     Crystal Orb in aquarium    ÃÂÃÂ        An aquarium is an artificial environment that requires careful balance of the already-skewed trophic structure, because of the artificial nutrition source (feed) and semi-intense culture condition (density of animals). ÃÂÃÂ      The role of microbe in aquarium    Most of the time, the aquarium nurtures a large number of invisible organisms which are largely responsible for some of the muddy appearances and fish sickness. To meet the high appearance standards of home decoration, microorganisms need to be strictly controlled.       One of the most common methods of controlling microbes is chemical treatment. The aquarium and aquaculture industry has relied on chemical salts and synthesized antibiotics because those treatments are accessible. The direct consequence:  aquarium water becomes a ""soup"" of chemicals; and discharging aquarium water is pouring chemicals into the soil. ÃÂÃÂ This abuse not only leads to negative environmental impact, but also slowly reinforces the ""addiction"" of chemical use.  Crystal Orb is intended to stop this.        The most common and effective routine of aquariums is water change. Monthly water change is almost required regardless of the condition of the water. Especially with antibiotic treatments, the frequency of water treatment is as high as 3 times a week. With Crystal Orb, the water change can be dramatically reduced.  A bucket less water change is a bucket of water saved!  For a home aquarium (20-gal), Crystal orb can help save 60-100 gallons per year!ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ      Predicted water save on a 20-gal home aquarium    ÃÂÃÂ        Crystal Orb adapted the nanomaterial that maintains its physical form while under water. That means:  no soluble chemical!  Through the oxidation-reduction reactions on the surface, the Crystal Orb creates a ""sterile zone"" that eliminates all single cell organisms upon contact. With water flow and physical filtration, the entire water body can be sterilized and dead cells will be removed. With these qualities,  Crystal Orb is the perfect alternative to your current water clarifier, algaecide, anti-fungi and antibiotics combined!

Many milestone results are posted in the Gallery section. Be sure to check them out!         Avoiding routine chemical addition is also a huge advantage in time management. Normal chemical treatments require routinely additions on a weekly basis, or bi-daily treatments for fish antibiotics. Comparatively, Crystal Orb follows a  one-time  1-2-3 protocol:  1. remove the Crystal Orb from its package; 2. rinse it with water for 30 sec; 3. place it into the aquarium (preferablyÃÂÃÂ near the filter).  Once the Crystal Orb is in,  NO MORE TREATMENTS . The microorganism associated symptoms will not bother you forÃÂÃÂ  6 months  (  one Crystal Orb for 15-gal indoor aquariumÃÂÃÂ or 7.5-gal outdoor aquarium  ).     Crystal Orb can attach to aquarium wall using suction cup    ÃÂÃÂ      place the Crystal Orb near filter for best performance    ÃÂÃÂ        Economically, despite the costly production of the new nanomaterial, this version of Crystal Orb still manages to be competitive to all alternative products.ÃÂÃÂ      Crystal Orb is a worthy investment    Routine use of major brand chemical treatments can cost $80-$240/yr for a 15 to 20-gal aquarium; a set UV lights costs a minimum of $60 with constant electricity bill; a pair of Crystal Orbs only cost $35. Therefore,  choosing Crystal Orb is a money-saving decision.        ÃÂÃÂ          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        The nanomaterial will lose its capability of balancing ion composition eventually. That is why this product has an optimal usage duration of 3-6 months and a shelf-life of 3 years.  The good news is: the nanomaterial is rechargeable!  The recharged nanomaterial will function the same and the cost is substantially lower.ÃÂÃÂ   As we are preparing the Kickstarter campaign, we are also designing the future logistics of the recycling and recharging service for retail market (products in-use for 6 months). Those strategies will include  mail-in used product for rebate  and  subscription service for continuous exchange .  We want toÃÂÃÂ bring less trash to the environment and more savings to all users. ÃÂÃÂ What a Win-Win!  ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  Scientific excellency has been our primary focus during all tests and development. Great efforts have been invested to ensure the safety and efficacy of each every product, no matter to the users or to the cultured animals. We have tested marine and fresh-water finfish and crustaceans. However, the aquarium industry has many diverse demands. Rare and exotic species enter the market all the time. Despite our confidence, there are many ornamental species such as jellyfish, coral and molluscs that have not yet been tested. Please apply Crystal Orb with caution. Also, if you are interested to help us expand the list of species that are comfortable with Crystal Orb, we encourage and welcome you to contact us with your experience.  The development stage is the most time-consuming stage, and that is all behind us. With the current production scale, the produced nanomaterial can already supply a medium-size market. With assembly and QC inspection, we will manage to fulfill the orders on time. We are as eager as you are to have Crystal Orb in your aquarium!  For any unforeseeable challenges, we will keep you updated. Thank you for your support!"

ÃÂÃÂ   Couple this with changing technology in many aspects and we have ourselves some huge contradicting and misleading information.ÃÂÃÂ   We are not trying to discount medical advice in any way but we simply want to create a network and platform for Mommies to come together and share all things Mommy- and Daddy-hood. ÃÂÃÂ   One such example is the enormous stigma that seems to surround Mommies that are formula-feeding their little ones. ÃÂÃÂ Now although we 100% agree that breastmilk is the best nutrition, we all have to agree that it is not always possible. ÃÂÃÂ Not only just by lifestyle but also through some Mommies not being able to Breast-feed. ÃÂÃÂ There are tons of reports of Mommies being told that they are bad Mommies because they are formula feeding without taking into account the fact that they just cannot breastfeed.  Along with debunking stigma, our Platform is also aimed at bringing Mommies together and providing a safe and supportive community for them to thrive in. ÃÂÃÂ We understand that not all Mommies face the exact same difficulties with relationship differences, Finance differences and even complications, bringing Mommies and Daddies together will go a very long way.   Right now we are working on our website that will be aimed at some massive content surrounding all things Mommies and Daddies. ÃÂÃÂ   Our dream is to take this a whole lot further in fulfilling our mission and creating something that will span right around the world. ÃÂÃÂ   Your pledge will really help us in continuing to move and get this dream off the ground, placing you right at the forefront of something magnificent!ÃÂÃÂ    Our Website Front Page Right Now, Check it Out At  www.mommypouch.com            Risks and challenges  We see very little risk in getting our project out there since it is based off our website and community and it being built.  Progress is already being made and we are in the process of getting awareness out there."

The device is composed of a monitoring camera and a vibrating screen. The latter has an integrated transmitter that is connected to the flashing and vibrating receivers.ÃÂÃÂ    This technical innovation would allow deaf parents to be autonomous with their newborn and restore their confidence in their ability to care for their baby alone.                  It is the only babyphone connected to  flashing and vibrating receivers  that will silently alert not only the hearing but also the deaf and hard of hearing. ÃÂÃÂ   When the baby starts crying, the surveillance camera will detect the scream through its built-in microphone. It will transmit it to the screen which will start vibrating and immediately send a signal to the flashing and vibrating receivers:  Cube flash, Vibrating Cushion, Flash plug, and other Jenile receivers.                  The  Flash Cube CBM19  is a product to be placed on the desk, for example. This cube centralizes all the different types of alarms with a color code associated with each type.ÃÂÃÂ You can  connect it to the Connected and Vibrating Baby Monitor Camera (BBC18)  and the associated color code is blue.  The  Vibrating Cushion COV15  is placed under the pillow and plugged directly into the Jenile receivers (Cube Flash and Flash Plug)  to be alerted of everything that happens in the house while you sleep . As soon as the flash receives a signal, it switches on and transmits the alert to the Vibrating Cushion.ÃÂÃÂ  Sleep in peace!

ÃÂÃÂ    Hassen CHAÃÂÃÂEB,  a deaf person, he devoted himself for years to the conception of Jenile products. In 2014, he and his children founded their family business:  Jenile International.    His objective is to offer better accessibility to deaf people  by helping them to improve their daily lives and develop.  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ In 2016, he became laureate of the regional competition for business creation organized by the French Bank ""Banque Populaire"" and was awarded the double prize of "" the family business "".   What solutions does Jenile International offer?   Jenile International  develops powerful tools  to help people with hearing loss on a daily basis. It carries out the development of housing, companies and public housing to make them accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing public.  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ The deaf population in a few figures....ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ   What are the difficulties faced by deaf and hard of hearing people?   They have difficulties to follow a conversation and they can't hear loud sounds such as doorbells, alarms or baby crying.... ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ They can be put at risk because they do not hear any warning sounds.    What do they need?ÃÂÃÂ    Speak slowly and articulate in front of people who are deaf or hard of hearing so that they can read lips.  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ They also need the sounds to be transcribed by vibrating and flashing signals in order to alert them in all situations.  * According to statistics from the World Health Organization : ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¯http://www.who.int/fr/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss  ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ  Our TeamÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ            Risks and challenges  For years, Hassen CHAÃÂÃÂ¯EB has been working on the development of technical aids for the deaf and hard of hearing. His main goal was to overcome all the difilcuties that the deaf and hard of hearing could encounter in their daily life. He has always wanted to offer the same accessibility that hearing people and this is why he founded Jenile International.   For example, in a maternity ward, a hearing woman has the right to keep her baby on the first night. While a deaf woman cannot babysit her child on the first night for safety reasons. Indeed, if she falls asleep during the night and the baby starts crying, she won't hear it.  This is also the case when parents are at home, parents are constantly on the alert. They cannot leave their child alone at night in the room without any supervision as they may not notice that the child has woken up in the night.   That's why Jenile International developed the Connected and Vibrating Baby Monitor Camera (BBC18). Thanks to its unique device with flashing and vibrating receivers, parents will be alerted if the baby starts crying. It is a safety device that has been designed to ensure that parents can be autonomous and serene when welcoming their newborn child into their home.  It is a challenge for us to develop this camera because it must be exactly adapted to the needs of deaf people. Launching this camera on Kickstarter is a way to raise awareness around the world of the extent to which deaf people have a blatant lack of accessibility in their daily lives. It is also important for us to promote the baby surveillance camera and our products to the international deaf community to show them that solutions exist and are within their reach.   So Kickstarter help us to carry out our project to the end and support us with your powerful community!"

We'll also set aside some travel funding so that the grant recipient can come to a future PROCJAM (2018 onwards) and talk about the cool stuff they did!        PROCJAM is an event celebrating generative software, from programs that stitch intricate artworks to games that simulate the history of fictional worlds. ÃÂÃÂ For the past three years the Procedural Generation Jam has taken place every November, bringing in artists, programmers, game developers, designers, and more together to  Make Something That Makes Something . Over nine days people make toys, games, experiments, tools, and other wonderful things that generate stuff through code.  But PROCJAM is more than just a jam - we're trying to help grow the generative software community, to introduce people to new ideas, to create resources to help people learn, and to organise communication channels to let people share their ideas. In the past we've been lucky enough to get funding to help with these things, but this year we want to try a new experiment in making PROCJAM sustainable - we want your help to fund this year's event!  Why We Need Funding  Here's what we're planning for this year's PROCJAM to make it the best yet.        A brand new art pack. ÃÂÃÂ We'll hire an artist to create a Creative Commons-licensed art pack that's designed to be used in generative projects. Released in time for the jam, and then freely available forever,  along with our existing three packs !        Seeds, Issue 2.  Last year we made a zine that invited everyone to contribute and share their ideas, dreams and work with the community. Organising and editing this was a huge task - the Kickstarter will pay for an editor to put this zine together for a second year.        Video coverage. ÃÂÃÂ PROCJAM doesn't have winners or losers, so to celebrate the hard work everyone puts in we hire game jam expert Jupiter Hadley to make videos about everyone's entries, so that everyone gets a chance in the spotlight!        Tutorials. ÃÂÃÂ Our new addition for 2017. We've promised for so long to create original tutorials to help people get started with procedural generation. This year we're planning to hire community members to write tutorials to share their knowledge, and add to our year-round collection of great procedural generation resources.  As usual, we're also planning to host our day of live talks to start the jam. Every year we collect experts from all around the generative software world to give talks to inspire and teach people. Our talks are broadcast live on YouTube and archived for later on.ÃÂÃÂ We're still planning to make this year's talks day happen, but there are some unknown factors this year in organising the event, so we're not raising funds for it this time. For this year, we're going to focus on Kickstarting our crucial resources, and fund our talks day separately.ÃÂÃÂ   Backer Rewards  Backing us at any tier means you're helping keep PROCJAM growing and supporting a cool community. We'll include your name in our zine and on our live stream! PROCJAM only happens because it has a kind and supportive community - thanks for being a part of it.  If you back us for ÃÂÃÂ£10 or more, you'll receive an amazing reward:  The Generative Mixtape , a collection of small experiments and unreleased projects from some amazing people:    Kate Compton ÃÂÃÂ [ Tracery ,  Crystal Code Palace, Techne ]   Tom Betts ÃÂÃÂ [ Sir!

This mixtape is a unique collection of cool stuff, produced by some wonderful people from the community. You won't want to miss out on it!  Stretch Goals  After we met our initial funding goal, we announced some stretch goals that we'd like to try and hit with additional funding. Here's what we'll do with your funding above our original goal:   ÃÂÃÂ£3,000 - A Second Art Pack [STRETCH GOAL MET!]   If we clear this stretch goal we can afford to hire another artist and produce a second art pack! Last year we had both a 2D and a 3D art pack, and the variety was amazing, so I really hope we can do the same this year!   ÃÂÃÂ£4,000 - Tutorials, Translated! [STRETCH GOAL MET]   Part of community building is getting resources in place for people, but another part is making sure those resources are accessible. Our plan for this stretch goal is to translate the tutorials we make into new languages. We're looking at translations into  Spanish  and  Arabic  with this initial stretch goal.   ÃÂÃÂ£5,000 - The PROCJAM Grant   If we meet this stretch goal, we'll award a financial support grant to someone working on a generative project, judged and awarded by a panel of experts from the community. We'll also set aside some travel funding so that the grant recipient can come to a future PROCJAM (2018 onwards) and talk about the cool stuff they did!        Risks and challenges  PROCJAM usually has a day of talks associated with it. This Kickstarter isn't for funding that, because they have lots of risks and variability. We want to focus on things we can 100% deliver. Even if our physical talks day doesn't take place, PROCJAM 2017 will still happen online as it always does, and all of our resources funded by this Kickstarter will help it happen.  All of our other objectives, from editing zines to creating art, are much less unpredictable. In the past we've always delivered our art packs, zines and so forth well in advance of deadlines, and they've always been super awesome.  That said, upheaval and unpredictable life changes do happen, so some of our goals may end up delivering later if something unexpected happens with the individual people involved. We'll work hard to make sure everything gets finished eventually, but equally we won't pressure the amazing people creating things for us to overwork themselves just to meet a deadline. Working healthily is a big part of PROCJAM!"

The searches by tourist attraction (eg Buckingham palace, Tower of London, etc ...) are characterized by text pages that require a real study to be able to subsequently build a guide.ÃÂÃÂ    To do this, needs a team composed of as many people as possible        Here the idea began to take shape. Considering the difficulty for the individual, to build a detailed and complete video guide, wouldn't it be better to build a platform designed to put everyone's strength together?   It was the 11 November 2018  and the idea exploded in my head like 1000 firecrackers in the New Year, I couldn't wait any longer and I started asking myself the most disparate questions!       It took a few months but now I have the answer to all the questions:  What is Travel Vips? ÃÂÃÂ   Travel Vips is a streaming platform for tourist guides, which also opens up the market to those who do not work like professional tour guide(everyone).  Upload your video guide or take advantage of that of others and if you are a professional tour guide, offer also your services on the spot!   What functions will it have? ÃÂÃÂ   Basically, in order to simplify the tour of the city, this new app will allow the tourist to know which tourist attraction is closest to him/her and once chosen the tourist attraction or the city of interest, the user will have a feed of guides created and evaluated by other users, accessing a gallery of specific and quality video guides.ÃÂÃÂ   The notification system will allow to invite people to look at the guide you might have uploaded and Following the viewing, to each user will be asked to check whether or not it is a guide and to evaluate the quality of this in terms of usefulness and lived experience!ÃÂÃÂ    Will it be yours, the next 5-star guide?   What are the advantages of creating a Video guide? ÃÂÃÂ   The biggest problem was: ""how do I encourage users to upload guides?"" Knowing the job that it requires and the time it needs, I think it is right that the revenue that will come from Travel Vips will be shared with those who will support its growth.  Your guide will become a digital product and you can take advantage of a system of incentives that rewards the quantity and quality of contents.  This means that following 100 evaluations, if your guide is evaluated at 4 or 5 stars, it will be assigned a price, and the one hundred and first tourist and those following will have to pay 0.80 cents or ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ 1 to watch your guide and guarantee a 100% quality experience!   For more information about the incentive system, go to www.TravelVips.it   What does Travel Vips offer to tourists? ÃÂÃÂ   Travel Vips in addition to providing geographical indications about the tourist attractions that can be visited provides tourists the possibility to choose between:   The single video tourist guide; ÃÂÃÂ     The complete video guide of the city (group of single videos); ÃÂÃÂ     The certified tour guide to meet on the spot; ÃÂÃÂ     And the V.I.P membership. ÃÂÃÂ    The V.I.P membership is a solution that can be of benefit to the user according to his needs.  It will remove the advertisement from the app and give access to Podcasts, offline mode, and all the digital products (4 and 5 stars)ÃÂÃÂ    And currently there are two ways to become V.I.P:   ÃÂÃÂ  Believe in Travel Vips , me and my project and support me via  kickstarter ; ÃÂÃÂ     Or: Become V.I.P once the app is a reality. ÃÂÃÂ    The substantial difference lies in the fact that  the membership you get by donating will be without deadlines and without any extra cost, while the V.I.P membership that will be available for purchase on the app will cost $ 3.40 per day . A price designed to prevent that the V.I.P membership ""cannibalize"" the sales of individual videos.  But regardless of this, I ask your help as a traveler, as a dreamer, as a man who can never realize his dream without you, knowing that your participation is fundamental, I'd like to see you be part of this revolution of tourist guides online as a  leader.   I ask for your help hoping that, even today, realizing a dream is possible. Regardless of whether you intend to donate or not, I invite you to be an active member of this community. Compare and exchange tips with other travelers, share  Travel Vips  and tell your friends and relatives what I'm doing.  Help me spread the idea!    How to donate? and what will i get in retun?   It is possible to donate from one euro upwards and the membership is obtained at a price which, as defined by this  article  ""is a figure that I do not find absolutely absurd, indeed.""   From 12 euros upwards you will get lifetime V.I.P membership (never pay the daily fee of $ 3.40) ÃÂÃÂ     From 19 euros up, get the Lifetime Membership plus the Travel Vips T-shirt. ÃÂÃÂ    For any questions contact me. A big hug, Alex.  The aforementioned article its in italian but i traslated it for you:   ""how many of you, after organizing the trip, found themselves on the spot without knowing what to do? To me, it's happened and even when I did research to organize a draft itinerary finally I relied on the advice of the hotel staff therefore throwing away a lot of time and energy. And what if you travel a lot and want to earn some extra income making your experience available for others?    Hi and welcome again on ""il Quadernino"" that today presents a new emerging platform, which I would like to see become reality, becouse I was really impressed by the business idea.    Just yesterday I came across this Kickstarter project,    travelvips.it   , a completely Italian project who wants to create a community around the travel world where exchange advice about the various tourist destinations to allow those who decide to go on vacation, to have all the information necessary to enjoy their stay to the fullest. Many of you may say that this service would be useless and that everyone with an internet connection can find all the information they need. In this case, I would answer that often the amount of time spent on finding museums, fairs, shows, etc. it's not always anought to find what we interest us most. Often needs to read a lot of articles, reviews and websites to find the one we like most, often with little results. But then wouldn't it be better to know the experience of someone who has already been there and can therefore provide us all the useful information quickly and easily? time is money after all. And my attention goes right on this point, becouse what surprised me most about the project is that everyone can improvise as a tour guide, sharing their experience on the platform and earning money. Oh yes, because the project foresees that every person who participates by creating tourist guide videos will be remunerated depending on how much that is used by other users, favoring ""tourist guides"" who will create quality content useful to other users. So the more your content is evaluated positively, the more you will earn.    In addition to this, even those who are currently professional tour guides will be able to use the portal to act as a guide on the touristi attraction and thus increase the reach of potential customers. In short, a great possibility for both professionals and amateurs.    The basic service will of course be free, but for those who want to enjoy the best guides without ads, a paid membership will also be offered, but here comes the beauty. For those who participate in the Kickstarter campaign there will be an automatic VIP membership, without having to pay additional costs or anything else. The minimum donation to receive the VIP membership is ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ 12, a figure that I don't find absolutely absurd, indeed    I must admit that I was very impressed by the business idea, also because it is still another way to increase earnings, obviously if you are interested in the travel world (but who is not). I leave the link to the description page of the    project    as well as for the    Kickstarter    campaign, in case you are interested like me, and also the connection to the    Facebook Page    of the project to stay informed about the progress of the project. Let me know in the comments section below what you think, I thank you for reading this presentation for the travelvips.it project and I invite you to the next update of ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>il QuaderninoÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ.ÃÂÃÂ      Thanks to quadernino.blog for these beautiful words!                Travel Vips ÃÂÃÂ¨ un luogo dove scambiarsi opinioni, consigli ed esperienze di viaggio,    il suo punto forte ÃÂÃÂ¨ la community.    Tu insieme a tutti gli altri viaggiatori, siete la forza di Travel Vips!   Chiunque abbia mai organizzato un viaggio sa perfettamente che i suggerimenti di persone che hanno gia avuto esperienza sul luogo possono essere di vitale importanza per la riuscita di un viaggio ed ecco il perchÃÂÃÂ© di Travel Vips, perchÃÂÃÂ¨  insieme, possiamo essere tutti ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>persone veramente importantiÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ per qualcun altro!   LÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>obiettivo principale ÃÂÃÂ¨ di semplificare la ricerca di informazioni turistiche con una piattaforma streaming, in cui, ognuno, senza necessariamente avere alcuna certificazione, potrÃÂÃÂ  caricare le proprie guide turistiche Video mentre le guide turistiche certificate potranno anche proporsi per appuntamenti sul luogo.ÃÂÃÂ   Insomma, iniziamo insieme come squadra su Facebook per poi convogliarci tutti in una piattaforma tutta nostra! Presto entrerÃÂÃÂ² in maggiori dettagli, ma nel frattempo...   Chi si cela dietro Travel Vips?        Io sono Alessandro, nato a Messina nel 1993, studente di economia ed appassionato di marketing e musica rock.  Mi reputo una persona di grande inventiva e se dovessi farti un elenco di tutte le idee che ho avuto non basterebbe questa pagina. Posso dire di aver avuto una vita normalissima, ma sono stato particolarmente influenzato da un evento drastico che mi cambiÃÂÃÂ² la vita per sempre. NellÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>agosto del 2009, esattamente 10 anni fa, ebbi un brutto incidente, che mi causÃÂÃÂ² trauma cranico e facciale, mi risvegliai in ospedale dopo un operazione interminabile e 12 ore di coma farmacologico e solo negli anni successivi, elaborato lÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>evento, mi resi conto di cosa vuol dire sfiorare la morte.ÃÂÃÂ        La mia alta ambizione ÃÂÃÂ¨ quella di diventare un bravo imprenditore attento allÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ambiente che contribuisca a migliorare la vita propria e quella degli altri ed il mio scopo nobile ÃÂÃÂ¨ essere ricordato come una delle persone che ha donato di piÃÂÃÂ¹ a questo mondo. Magari non ci riuscirÃÂÃÂ² mai, ma nel frattempo io continuerÃÂÃÂ² ogni giorno ed ogni minuto della mia vita ad impegnarmi verso questÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>obiettivo ed a donare per quello che posso, per poter dire un giorno: ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>ci sono riuscito!ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ o ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>ce lÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ho messa tutta!ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ  Ad oggi, ecco lÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ennesima idea. E dopo anni, questa ha un potenziale superiore a tutte le altre!  LÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>idea ÃÂÃÂ¨ nata in seguito alla pubblicazione di alcuni ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Video guidaÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ creati da me e costituiti da un format che suddivideva ogni guida in: 3 posti da vedere, 3 piatti tipici, un esperienza da vivere sul posto ed una curiositÃÂÃÂ . Questo Format era apprezzato, ma volendomi differenziare, tentai di mettere a disposizione maggiori informazioni per il mio pubblico tentando di creare delle guide complete.  Ecco che scoprÃÂÃÂ¬, quello che io chiamo:  il problema delle informazioni turistiche!   Le ricerche per attrazione turistica (es. Buckingham palace, Torre di londra, ecc...) sono caratterizzate da pagine di testo che richiedono un vero e proprio studio per poterne costruire in seguito una guida.  Per fare ciÃÂÃÂ², serve una squadra che sia il piÃÂÃÂ¹ numerosa possibile!        Ecco che lÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>idea cominciava a prendere forma. Visto questa difficoltÃÂÃÂ  per il singolo, di costruire una guida video dettagliata e completa, non sarebbe meglio, costruire una piattaforma studiata apposta mettendo insieme le forze di tutti?ÃÂÃÂ    Era lÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>11 novembre 2018  e lÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>idea mi esplose in testa come 1000 petardi a capodanno, non stetti piÃÂÃÂ¹ nella pelle e cominciai a farmi le domande piÃÂÃÂ¹ disparate!       CÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ÃÂÃÂ¨ voluto qualche mese ma adesso ho la risposta a tutte le domande:  CosÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ÃÂÃÂ¨ Travel Vips?ÃÂÃÂ   Travel Vips ÃÂÃÂ¨ una piattaforma streaming di guide turistiche, che apre il mercato anche a chi non fa la guida di professione senza trascurare le guide Turistiche certificate.  Carica la tua guida o usufruisci di quella degli altri e se sei una guida turistica certificata, offri anche i tuoi servizi sul posto!   Che funzioni avrÃÂÃÂ ?  Di base questa nuova app, permetterÃÂÃÂ  al turista di sapere quale attrazione turistica gli ÃÂÃÂ¨ piÃÂÃÂ¹ vicina, allo scopo di semplificargli il percorso di visita della cittÃÂÃÂ  e una volta scelta lÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>attrazione turistica o la cittÃÂÃÂ  di interesse, lÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>utente avrÃÂÃÂ  a disposizione un feed di guide create e valutate dagli altri utenti, accedendo ad una galleria di video guide specifiche e di qualitÃÂÃÂ .ÃÂÃÂ   Il sistema di notifiche presente in tutte le app permetterÃÂÃÂ  di invitare le persone a guardare la guida che potresti aver caricato tu stesso. In seguito alla visione, ad ogni utente verrÃÂÃÂ  chiesto di verificare se si tratti o meno di una guida e di valutarne la qualitÃÂÃÂ  di questÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ultima in termini di utilitÃÂÃÂ  ed esperienza vissuta!  SarÃÂÃÂ  la tua, la prossima guida a 5 stelle?   Che vantaggi ho a creare una guida Video?  Il problema piÃÂÃÂ¹ grande era: ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>come incentivo gli utenti a caricare guide?ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ. Sapendo il lavoro che richiede ed il tempo che ne necessita, trovo giusto che le entrate che deriveranno da Travel Vips vengano condivise con chi ne supporterÃÂÃÂ  la crescita.  La tua guida, diventerÃÂÃÂ  un prodotto digitale e potrai usufruire di un sistema di incentivi che premia la quantitÃÂÃÂ  e la qualitÃÂÃÂ  dei contenuti.  CiÃÂÃÂ² vuol dire che in seguito a 100 valutazioni, qualora la tua guida venga valutata a 4 o 5 stelle, le verrÃÂÃÂ  assegnato un prezzo, ed il centounesimo turista e quelli successivi dovranno pagare 0,80 cent o 1 ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ per guardare la tua guida e garantirsi un esperienza al 100% di qualitÃÂÃÂ !   Per maggiori informazioni sul sistema di incentivi, vai su  www.TravelVips.itÃÂÃÂ   Cosa offre Travel Vips ai turisti?  Travel Vips oltre a fornire indicazioni geografiche riguardo le attrazioni turistiche visitabili mette a disposizione del turista la possibilitÃÂÃÂ  di scegliere tra:   La singola guida turistica video;    La guida turistica video completa della cittÃÂÃÂ  (gruppo di singoli video);    La guida turistica certificata da incontrare sul posto;    E la V.I.P membership.   La V.I.P membership ÃÂÃÂ¨ una soluzione che puÃÂÃÂ² essere a vantaggio dellÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>utente a seconda delle proprie necessitÃÂÃÂ .  RimuoverÃÂÃÂ  la pubblicitÃÂÃÂ  dallÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>app e conferirÃÂÃÂ    accesso a Podcast, ModalitÃÂÃÂ  offline, e a tutti i prodotti digitali (4 e 5 stelle )  E attualmente ci sono due modi per diventare V.I.P:   ÃÂÃÂ  Credi in Travel Vips , in me e nel mio progetto e sostienimi tramite  kickstarter ;    Oppure: Diventa V.I.P una volta che lÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>app sarÃÂÃÂ  realtÃÂÃÂ .   La differenza sostanziale sta nel fatto che  la membership che otterrai donando, sarÃÂÃÂ , senza scadenze e senza alcun costo extra, mentre la membership V.I.P che sarÃÂÃÂ  acquistabile sullÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>app, avrÃÂÃÂ  un costo di 3,40$ al giorno.  Un prezzo studiato per evitare che la membership V.I.P ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>cannibalizziÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ le vendite dei singoli video.  Ma a prescindere da questo, ti chiedo aiuto in quanto viaggiatore, in quanto sognatore, in quanto uomo che non potrÃÂÃÂ  mai realizzare il proprio sogno senza di te, sapendo che la tua partecipazione ÃÂÃÂ¨ fondamentale mi piacerebbe vederti far parte di questa rivoluzione delle guide turistiche online come un  leader .ÃÂÃÂ   Ti chiedo aiuto nella speranza che ancora, al giorno dÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>oggi, realizzare un sogno sia possibile. A prescindere che la tua intenzione sia quella di donare o meno, ti invito ad essere un membro attivo della community.  Confrontati e scambia consigli con altri viaggiatori , condividi Travel Vips e racconta ai tuoi amici e parenti cosa sto facendo. Aiutami a diffondere lÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>idea!  Come si dona? e cosa riceverÃÂÃÂ² in cambio?  ÃÂ<U+0088> possibile donare da un euro in su e la membership si ottiene ad un prezzo che, per come ÃÂÃÂ¨ stato definito da questo  articolo  ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>ÃÂÃÂ¨ una cifra che non trovo assolutamente assurda, anzi.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ   Da 12 euro in su otterrai la membership V.I.P a vita (non pagare mai la daily fee di 3,40$)    Da 19 euro in su ricevi la Membership a vita piÃÂÃÂ¹ la maglietta di Travel Vips.

We know that we have little in the way of competition ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> We focus on differentiating our offer by building a video and audio tour guiding platform were videos are subdivided by tourist destination and became digital products.

The plan is to get this film into high schools as part of the wellness curriculum so we can use dance to impact our next generation in a positive way and to change how our teenagers see themselves and others.ÃÂÃÂ   In order to capture the attention of teenagers we need to communicate with them via a platform that connects and engages them. The answer is simply; technology, music, dance, art and film. We know our important subject matter will be better received through this preferred form of communication, rather than a monotonous, stuffy and mundane lecture. Our program is the vehicle that will engage them.  The program will be delivered through a feature film, with six character storylines portrayed through current and modern dance styles, including hip hop, jazz, dance hall, fusion and contemporary.ÃÂÃÂ      Dance Crew       Dance Crew    The film focuses on a group of school friends who face personal challenges such as bullying, anxiety and identity crises. The film will portray real life situations dealt with by today's teenagers and explores the power of social media and online bullying on their mental health.ÃÂÃÂ    Throughout the film, we will have ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>learning momentsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ, where the film will pause in pivotal occasions in the characters story lines, to allow the students to dissect, process and evaluate what they are learning in groups, as well as independently.ÃÂÃÂ    The students will execute this via a log-in to our website, where they will be able to answer the vital discussion questions presented in the film, to assess what they are learning about themselves and their peers. It will also shine a light on their decision making abilities and their emotional and mental well-being; via the physical, with the eventual purpose to start an important dialogue with their peers.ÃÂÃÂ    The message will be delivered to teenagers by teenagers, who understand the implications and the expectations social media places on their age demographic.

I designed my 1st alteration to a transportation rack that was approved by a engineer at a top automotive company.I was happy but soon came to find the idea was used but I never was paid. Something sparked inside of me beyond my anger...determination. I knew I had great ideas and began the journey of embracing my imagination. When I designed the filter frame I knew IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>d give anything to see it come to life. I ended up giving everything but still having hope as I slept at the park in my car. The frame will change the world so that month and a half was worth the struggle . I cried the day I recieved my patent. I felt pride knowing all that I went through as a young black inventor was not in vein. The filter frame was designed simple to use and easy to understand. I located a filter directly at the exit point of air flow.For countless years the consumer has accepted the quality of air they breathe after the HVAC filter process air at the entrance point for air flow. We are raising the bar because acceptable is not good enough. We want the best for everything that life has to offer. Our family deserves the best. No matter if your an allergen sufferer or simply desire to increase the quality of air emitted out of your homes air duct. Utilizing a filter frame to catch the unwanted dust, irritants, and debree at the exit location (register) is the best opportunity to reduce and eliminate the problem. The technology to protect our families and take a leap into the future has been created. For all of you who believe ÃÂÃÂ what we can witness take place in the next 6 month ..join with me. IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve given everything I have and still have more to give. The world will be forever thankful for your contribution. I will be grateful for your support and call you a member of our filter frame family. Thank youÃÂÃÂ   Joshua Cannon      Risks and challenges  This venture is one that was formed from faith. I am currently working with a 3rd party to manage the overseas manufacturing options. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to trust people to do right by my project. The mold that will be used to build the frames will range from 25 to 30,000 dollars. A big portion of the pledges will cover the cost of the mold. IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll produce 5,000 frames for the 1st run and utilize the last 10 or 15,000 on marketing."

NatÃÂÃÂ¼rlich wusste ich von der antibakteriellen Wirkung des Silbers und der Verwendung in Textilien, wie z.B. in UnterwÃÂÃÂ¤sche zur Linderung von Allergien und AusschlÃÂÃÂ¤gen. Auch gibt es bereits SpÃÂÃÂ¼ltÃÂÃÂ¼cher am Markt, die mit silberhaltigen ImprÃÂÃÂ¤gnierungen behandelt wurden um das Wachstum von geruchsbildenden Bakterien zu verhindern.  Hier war also mein Ausgangspunkt. Doch kann antibakterielles Silber in einer Textilie ÃÂÃÂ¼berhaupt eine derartige EffektivitÃÂÃÂ¤t erzielen, dass ruhigen Gewissens auf Desinfektionsmittel verzichtet werden kann? Wie stellt man ein Reinigungstuch her, dass ÃÂ<U+0096>le und Fette aufnimmt, obwohl man nur mit reinem Wasser wischt?     Manfred Fixl    Nach vielen Jahren intensiver TÃÂÃÂ¼ftelei, UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzung durch ÃÂ<U+0084>rzte, Umweltmediziner, Textil- und Reinigungsfachleute, aber auch inklusive ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009E>kreativer"" Pausen und jeder Menge Prototypen, die den eigenen hohen Anspruch an Perfektion noch nicht erfÃÂÃÂ¼llen konnten, ist heute die Zeit reif, der Welt die  Superfaser  vorzustellen. Eine in ÃÂ<U+0096>sterreich entwickelte und in Deutschland produzierte High-Tech-Textilie mit auÃÂ<U+009F>ergewÃÂÃÂ¶hnlichen Eigenschaften.

None of the displayed Products is currently available)  oder folge uns bei   Instagram ÃÂÃÂ   Das Silber, so filigran verwebt und untrennbar mit der Hauptfaser verbunden. Dies war meine grÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂ<U+009F>te Herausforderung, die mittlerweile perfekt gemeistert wurde. Die verarbeiteten Fasern werden vor dem Einweben mittels einem speziellen Verfahren angeschliffen. Damit wird zum einen die Schmutz aufnehmende OberflÃÂÃÂ¤che starkt vergrÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂ<U+009F>ert, zum anderen ermÃÂÃÂ¶glicht diese Beschaffenheit ein tieferes Eindringen in Poren, die in mikroskopischem MaÃÂ<U+009F>stab jede OberflÃÂÃÂ¤che besitzt. Auf diese Weise entfernt die MICROCLEAN Superfaser tief sitzende Verunreinigungen, die nur durch den Einsatz von reinem Wasser herausgelÃÂÃÂ¶st werden.ÃÂÃÂ   Zudem wurde in mehreren Gutachten von BehÃÂÃÂ¶rden und unabhÃÂÃÂ¤ngigen Instituten zweifelsfrei bestÃÂÃÂ¤tigt, dass OberflÃÂÃÂ¤chen, die mit der MICROCLEAN Superfaser und reinem Wasser gereinigt wurden, zu 99,9% von Keimen und Erregern befreit sind. (nach gÃÂÃÂ¤ngigen Testmethoden fÃÂÃÂ¼r marktÃÂÃÂ¼bliche Desinfektionsmittel) Doch darauf gehe ich spÃÂÃÂ¤ter noch ein.  Es entwickelt sich weltweit ein immer stÃÂÃÂ¤rkeres Bewusstsein, wie der ungehemmte Einsatz von Chemikalien und dieÃÂÃÂ VermÃÂÃÂ¼llungÃÂÃÂ der GewÃÂÃÂ¤sser und Umwelt durch Mikroplastik unsere LebensgrundlageÃÂÃÂ kontinuierlichÃÂÃÂ zerstÃÂÃÂ¶rt.  Eigentlich sind wir verpflichtet, alles zu unternehmen, um diesen Wahnsinn zu stoppen. Leider haben wir uns stark an die Nutzung von chemischen Reinigungsmitteln gewÃÂÃÂ¶hnt. Alleine der Geruch von Reinigern und Chlor wird in vielen KÃÂÃÂ¶pfen mit Hygiene gleich gesetzt. Diese Konditionierungen mÃÂÃÂ¼ssen aufgelÃÂÃÂ¶st werden. Viele disruptive Technologien, die nachhaltig sind und der Umwelt mehr dienen, als dem Kapital, werden nicht angemessen gefÃÂÃÂ¶rdert und etabliert. Manchmal sogar ausgebremst.  Mit unserer innovativen Superfaser kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen Millionen Tonnen Chemie und Kunststoffabfall weltweit vermieden werden. In allen Lebens- und Arbeitsbereichen!ÃÂÃÂ   Ich habe diese Produkte leidenschaftlich, unter groÃÂ<U+009F>en Anstrengungen und mit eigenen Mitteln zur vollen MarktfÃÂÃÂ¤higkeit gebracht. Nun kann sofort mit der ersten grÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂ<U+009F>eren und deshalb ÃÂÃÂ¶konomisch sinnvollen Serienproduktion gestartet werden.ÃÂÃÂ Bei der Herstellung wird mit komplexen Verfahren gearbeitet, welche schlecht bis ÃÂÃÂ¼berhaupt nicht kopierbar sind.  Ziel diesesÃÂÃÂ Crowdfunding-ProjektsÃÂÃÂ ist es, mÃÂÃÂ¶glichst viele Menschen zu erreichen, die allesamt Anwender und Fans unserer wertvollen Produkte werden und genauso groÃÂ<U+009F>e Freude haben an diesem groÃÂ<U+009F>en Gesundheits- und Umweltprojekt wie ich.  Bis heute wurden lediglich einige Prototypen der ""Medicine Line"" in Kleinserie hergestellt und an einen ausgewÃÂÃÂ¤hlten Kreis zu Testzwecken und fÃÂÃÂ¼r die Erstellung von bakteriologischen Gutachten verteilt. Mit der Wucht von Kickstarter mÃÂÃÂ¶chten wir nun erstmals grÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂ<U+009F>ere Chargen herstellen und aus dem damit erreichten wirtschaftlichen Erfolg die Weiterentwicklung der ""Health Line"" (fÃÂÃÂ¼r KÃÂÃÂ¶rperpflege und Demake-Up) finanzieren. Damit auch bei diesen Anwendungen auf tonnenweise Abfall wie Wattepads und Reinigungsmittel verzichtet werden kann.  Abgerundet wird die Produktpalette dann schliesslich mit der Optic Line, die Handy-Displays ohne Reinigungs- und Desinfektionsmittel keimfrei und fettfrei sÃÂÃÂ¤ubert. Genauso eignet sich die Optic Line fÃÂÃÂ¼r Bildschirme, Brillen, Linsen und Objektive.ÃÂÃÂ   MICROCLEANÃÂÃÂ  Superfasern ÃÂÃÂ mit jahrelanger LebensdauerÃÂÃÂ ermÃÂÃÂ¶glichen eine porentiefe und professionelle Reinigung nur mit reinem Wasser und tÃÂÃÂ¶ten dabei 99,9 % aller Keime und Bakterien.

My name is Manfred Fixl. ÃÂÃÂ I am from Upper Austria, from the MÃÂÃÂ¼hlviertel, the former weaving stronghold of Austria. My home town was also the only textile technical university in Austria. Already as a child I was enthusiastic about this craft and from an early age I was able to get a deep insight into the development and research of the textile academy through family connections. ÃÂÃÂ In the course of my career, I later came into contact with large companies in the professional cleaning industry.ÃÂÃÂ   When I noticed the dimensions of the enormous consumption of disease-causing and environmentally damaging chemicals for cleaning in my everyday work, this triggered my desire to do something about this flood of chemistry and (micro)plastics.  Of course I knew about the antibacterial effect of silver and its use in textiles such as underwear to alleviate allergies and rashes. There are also dishtowels on the market that have been treated with silver-containing impregnations to prevent the growth of odour-forming bacteria.  So this was my starting point. But can antibacterial silver in a fabric achieve such effectiveness that disinfectants can be dispensed with without any doubt? How do you make a cleaning cloth that absorbs oils and fats even though you only wipe with pure water?  After many years of intensive tinkering, support from doctors, environmental physicians, textile and cleaning experts, but also including ""creative"" breaks and lots of prototypes that have not yet been able to meet my own high standards of perfection, it is time today to present the SUPERFIBRE to the world. Developed and manufactured in Austria.  The silver, so filigree woven and inseparably connected with the main fibre. This was my greatest challenge, which has now been mastered perfectly. The processed fibres are sanded with a special process before weaving. On the one hand, this greatly increases the amount of the dirt-absorbing surface, and on the other hand, this structures allow deeper penetration into microscopically small unevennesses, which almost every surface has.ÃÂÃÂ   In addition, several expert opinions from authorities and independent institutes have confirmed beyond doubt that 99.9% of surfaces cleaned with MICROCLEAN cloths and pure water are free of germs and pathogens. (according to standard test methods for commercially available disinfectants) But I will go into this later.  There is a growing awareness worldwide how the uninhibited use of chemicals and the littering of waters and the environment by microplastics continuously destroys our basis of life.  Actually, we are obliged to do everything in our power to stop this madness. Unfortunately, we have become very accustomed to the use of chemical cleaning agents. The smell of cleaners and chlorine alone is equated with hygiene in many people's minds. These conditionings must be dissolved. Many disruptive technologies, which are sustainable and serve the environment more than profits, are not adequately promoted and established. Sometimes even slowed down.  With our innovative super fiber, millions of tons of chemicals and (micro)plastic waste can be avoided worldwide. In all areas of life and work!ÃÂÃÂ   I have made great efforts to bring the first Type of these Products close to perfection. Now we can start immediately with the first larger production.ÃÂÃÂ   The aim of this crowdfunding project is to create the economic conditions to become able to expand the Line of Products by the ""Health Line"" for body care and demake-up. To make it also in this category possible to save 100% Chemical Products and waste. Afterwards the product range will be completed by the ""Optic Line"", an even more refined variation which is being used for Smartphone Displays to clean those germ- and bacteria-free and remove any grease. Of course the Optic Line will be perfectly suitable for other Screens, Glasses, Lenses and other Optics too.  And of course: The larger the community of users, the higher the positive impact for our planet. Kickstarter is perfect to get the ball rolling and save the environment thousands of tons of chemicals and plastics.

My name is Kelvin and I am 28 years old. for the last 10 years I have been working with children of all ages. I have a strong passion for children. At the present moment, IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m currently a nanny, and a law student. When IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m not in school, I take care of 3 wonderful children. Often times taking care of the children is simple and easy, but other times It can be challenging. How so you might ask? Sometimes kids can entertain themselves and other times its my job to entertain them, or to find some fun activities to do with them. Lately I have found what I think to be a problem that I have a solution for. A few months ago, I was in Florida vacationing with the family I work for and the kids. 1 child had a friend that he knew at the resort and and other child found a place in the shade just to relax. That leaves one more child. I had already played with him, his parents already played with him. He was getting bored wishing he had someone new to play with. Right then and there, It hit me! Why isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t there an app to instantly schedule play dates for children?! There are apps for adults but no App for kids to socialize and network and meet other kids.   When I got back from vacation I did a ton of research, coming to find out that this idea has not been submitted! I had to jump on this fast. I obtained a patent for the layout and design for the app already and have already hired a developing team that has already started the process of creating the app. I have spent a lot of my own personal money and now IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m tapped out. Creating this app and going to law school has led me to kickstarter.  I am looking for backers who believe in my idea. If you have children or youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re a nanny and have ever been in that situation where you just wish you could entertain your child so theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re not driving you crazy, then this is the future, this will solve your problems!  I am seeking $15,000 dollars to complete the app. the sooner I raise this, the quicker I can launch! In July 2019, My New Pal will be an expo that draws over 25,000 people in Chicago. This is a step in the right direction to help gain publicity for the app!      Risks and challenges  The challenges that IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m facing are just money to continually pay my developers.

In 2015, I wanted to start a toll-free hotline for people that are contemplating violence with firearms. After hearing media reports of shootings across the country, I had asked myself many times why there wasn't such a telephone hotline. Due to health &amp; financial reasons, the project was abandoned.  Only a few days ago, a YouTube video popped up while viewing a channel about psychology. I had no idea what it was and let it play. The video was of a psychiatrist interviewing the Colorado movie theater shooter, James Holmes. It was a bit of a shock when Holmes discussed calling a mental health telephone number immediately before entering the theater. Holmes said, ""Just one last chance to see if I should turn back or not"". No one answered that call. Holmes entered the theater with firearms, body armor and teargas. He killed 12 people and wounded more than 70.  After hearing that, I knew that the hotline for people contemplating violence with firearms needed to become a reality and quickly. The website was quickly created, a toll-free number was obtained at (833) WAITONE or (833) 924-8663. The immediate needs are for legal costs for non-profit, trademark and other costs. After those needs are met, additional funding can be sought through grants.  The callers to the hotline will receive immediate, confidential support and if necessary local counseling will be scheduled to assist the caller. It is possible that the non-profit will have to pay for some of the local counseling. Wait One will grow a listing of qualified counselors willing to meet with clients. Wait One will also follow-up with the caller and counselor.  The long-term goals are to have more than one paid employee other than myself. The employee(s) will be appropriately qualified similar to a MSW or above. Of course, qualified volunteers would be utilized too. The employees will be responsible for taking calls, providing follow-up counseling, etc.ÃÂÃÂ   I am going on a cross country bicycle trip to promote the non-profit but will also be taking all the calls. Right now, WaitOne is doing whatever is possible to help people that are contemplating harming people with firearms. The potential callers go far beyond the mass shooters in the news. Inner city gang members, paroled convicts &amp; other vulnerable people will be targeted with advertising. During the bicycle tour, I plan to talk to gun store owners about placing a poster in their stores and soliciting other advice from the gun store employees.  I'm in this for the long haul and will see WaitOne become successful in preventing violence with firearms!      Risks and challenges  The challenges will be getting the hotline advertised well enough to receive callers. Advertising posters will be placed at gun stores and universities. Maintaining a long-term on-line presence with media coverage should help a lot. Funding may be an issue, but I'm in this for the long haul. The size of the organization WaitOne will not affect the availability of the hotline."

Tested by SWEREA IVF and has a proven cleaning effect according to the EU Ecolabel test for detergents.

And the service life of machines will be longer because, without detergent, no lime-scale buildup occurs.

Chemical residues remain on textiles after conventional washing., resulting in allergies, contact dermatitis, and aggravated eczema. Powder detergents contain zeolites, which appear as a fine dust with particles so small they can enter a personÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s lungs.  Other chemicals in detergents include sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), linear alkyl benzene sulfonates (LAS), petroleum distillates (also known as naphtha), and sodium hypochlorite (household bleach).  Many of the chemicals have negative effects on humans, animals, and/or the environment, such as skin irritation, organ toxicity, liver and kidney damage, toxicity to fish, reproductive and developmental problems in animals, and excessive growth of marine plants, triggering unbalanced ecosystems.  Fabric softeners also contain many hazardous chemicals, including chloroform, benzyl alcohol, ethanol, and linalool.  Human skin is frequently exposed to some of these chemicals as they remain in fabric after washing.  Our solution is also expected to contribute to SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, by reducing the use of chemicals in society, decreasing the need for transportation, and cutting energy consumption by shortening drying times, lowering washing temperatures, and sending less polluted wastewater to sewage treatment plants.  As for economic effects, it reduces service and maintenance costs, extends the service life of the machines, and lowers the cost per wash compared with conventional washing.  By reducing resource use, the solution will affect SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production.  The holding tanks are rotation molded with reused plastic.  Filters have been analysed by SYSAV in MalmÃÂÃÂ¶ and are classified as combustible waste.  The production will be outsourced to countries strategically selected to minimize the environmental impact.  Local household appliance service companies will install and service the systems.  The solution will also contribute to SDG 14: Life Below Water.  Sewer plants and septic systems process large quantities of wastewater but do not always operate properly or remove enough nitrogen and phosphorus before discharging into waterways.  Some detergents contain zeolites instead of phosphorus, and wastewater plants have problems removing these small particles from the water.  Another issue is that detergents and softeners contain microplastics.  Sweden also has over 700,000 private non-approved sewage systems where in many cases the greywater pollutants end up in the streams, lakes, and groundwater.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ     SWATAB owner of DIROÃÂÃÂ®, winner of MalmÃÂÃÂ¶ Cleantech City Award 2016   ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>A true innovation uses known technology in brand new applications.

Present Market   Commercial sites: Care Homes | Spa/Hotels/Apartments | Laundrettes | PPE, HiVis and Workwear  Surface Cleaners   Future Markets   Residential units  Commercial/Residential Kitchen Dish/Glass/Mop washers   Kickstarter   We will use the pledges from this Kickstarter to:  Boost the company which will help us to create more innovative uses for DIROÃÂÃÂ®.  Mobile units, possible utlra-clean detergent-free water units for disaster relief, festival events and shared community.       Ultra-clean detergent-free surface cleaners, allergy and environmentally friendly.       New cabinet designs and production to meet wider customer requirements.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Boost our Manufacturing team  Manufacturing in the UK will mean we can more easily prototype changes to the cabinets in which the patented DIROÃÂÃÂ® systems are installed and the positioning and size of the water tanks.  This will allow bespoke systems to be developed to meet varying customer demands for space and capacity.  Lead times and the carbon footprint of logistics can be greatly reduced.       DIROÃÂÃÂ® is tested according to the requirements of the EU-Eco Label tests for laundry detergents.The patented method of operation is divided into three main sections:  1. DIROÃÂÃÂ® is installed between your existing water feed and your washing machine and works with both new and old machinery. The sleek, Scandinavian designed unit processes the water through several filters so that it emerges ultra-clean and deionized. This filtered water is then pumped into your washing machine in the normal way.  Detergent Free.  2. When the water comes in contact with the fabrics in the washing machine it breaks the ionic bond between the fibres of the fabric and dirt. These unwanted particles are then carried away with the rinse water leaving the fabric clean and chemical free. Since the filtered water is ultra-pure and contains no lime scale or other minerals, the fabrics are left soft without the need for fabric softener. Fabrics are fragrance free and carry a pleasant, natural odour.  3. Since the filtered water is free from salt and minerals, the spin-cycle becomes more effective. Less water molecules bind to the fabric which results in a shorter drying time. This saves energy consumption from your tumble dryers by up to 40% and also saves on wear and tear on the tumble dryers themselves.  At present, all DIROÃÂÃÂ® systems are manufactured in Scandinavia, and when we order them we are having to take the distance into account for lead times, customisation and availability to customers.  We have an agreement in place to manufacture the DIROÃÂÃÂ® systems in the UK, what remains now is to boost our manufacturing capacity through pledges from this Kickstarter project.  Manufacturing in the UK will improve customisation capabilities and response time for customers allowing us to expand the business more easily.  The core functionality of DIROÃÂÃÂ® is washing without detergents. Allergy and Environmentally Friendly!  The following pictures shows how well a cold washing cycle with DIROÃÂÃÂ® is at cleaning away even the heavy dirt on firefighting clothing including HiVis and webbing.ÃÂÃÂ   Before:       After:       Before:       After:       ÃÂÃÂ        Washing with detergents leaves residue within the washing machines (see picture below).       ÃÂÃÂ   Washing with DIROÃÂÃÂ® and without detergents, means that all this residue is now history (see picture below).ÃÂÃÂ        Washing with mains water leaves lime-scale build-up on your machines heating elements, this is reducing the energy efficiency of your machine. (See picture below, left element).  Washing with DIROÃÂÃÂ® means that no lime-scale or dirt build up will occur within your washing machine. (See picture below, right element).       Both of these elements have been in use for 2.5 years (left: normal washing, right: DIROÃÂÃÂ® washing).  Washing with DIROÃÂÃÂ® does not leave lime-scale allowing machines to run better and reduce maintenance.  All of which is better for our environment.

We can overcome this by placing these orders with the patent holder in Sweden, but we would prefer to do the manufacturing in the UK so that we do not add carbon foot print through transportation."

Hi, I am Wayne Poerio, CEO and Co-founder of Soltair. ÃÂÃÂ I am a Chemical Engineer with more Mechanical engineering experience who was trained at Pratt Whitney on Lean Manufacturing. ÃÂÃÂ Our team applied Lean Product development to create Soltair. ÃÂÃÂ SOLTAIR stands for Solar Turbine Powered Air Conditioning. We are reinventing the air conditioner. ÃÂÃÂ Our cross functional engineering team has experience in jet engine turbine design, air conditioning design and Organic Rankine system development.ÃÂÃÂ   At Soltair we started the idea of Solar Turbine Powered Air Conditioning ÃÂÃÂ in our US garage as a way to reduce our monthly utility bill. Our Florida lifestyle guarantees we will always need air conditioning and paying for it should not be a challenge. As we progressed in our development we found we could also provide heating and hot water. ÃÂÃÂ We found our biggest benefit is in our ability to simultaneously reduce energy costs while reducing the impact of Global Warming. ÃÂÃÂ We have developed a method to stay cool without warming the planet. Our refrigerants are 5X lower Global impact as well as requiring 5X less electricity.ÃÂÃÂ        When you see a roof that is covered with Solar panels you may be surprised to know that at least 75% of the panels are needed just for air conditioning or heating. ÃÂÃÂ We knew that even though the cost of Solar PV has dropped over the last 10 years, it's just not a feasible option for the majority who really need it. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ At Soltair we saw an opportunity to totally change the meaning of Solar powered. We applied our experience in jet engines technology. ÃÂÃÂ At Soltair use the heat from sun to spin a shaft, instead of trying to convert the sun's energy into electricity. ÃÂÃÂ This change in approach allows Soltair to drastically reduce the cost of, ""Solar Powered"".ÃÂÃÂ        Our Solar panels are Solar Thermal not Solar PV. ÃÂÃÂ Solar Thermal panels are made to generate heat not create electricity (the ratio of Solar Thermal to Solar PV is 1:24). Here is what that means, the cost to implement is paid for within 16 months not years. It also means, we store energy in the form of hot water instead of batteries. That allows us to provide night time coverage. So for the frequently asked question, ""why not just use Solar PV""? ÃÂÃÂ The simple answer is because it's just not cost effective. ÃÂÃÂ At Soltair we feel that Solar PV can be more cost effective if a business or home uses our Soltair solution for air conditioning/heating and hot water and Solar PV for the remainder of their energy needs.ÃÂÃÂ   Pledge and upload your favorite climate change video.

ÃÂÃÂ We can not count on someone else to fund this worldwide need.       So where are we in our development? ÃÂÃÂ Our US utility patent was awarded in 2018. World patent is pending. Our engineering team worked with Parametric Solutions Inc (a +300 employee engineering company with experience in aircraft engines) to design and develop our demonstration unit. ÃÂÃÂ We have designed, built and successfully tested our Soltair 2.5 Ton sized system with a range from 1.5Ton to 2.5Ton at +90 SEER. ÃÂÃÂ Our next steps are to create the production version of a 1.5 ton system. That allows us to down scale our current demonstration unit from 2.5 tons to 1.5 tons. ÃÂÃÂ Soltair has entered the Global Cooling Prize challenge made by India and Sir Richard Branson (www.Global Coolingprize.org) that requires a 1.5Ton HVAC system. This Global Cooling challenge provides funding for two working units but does not provide funding to create a simplified production unit.ÃÂÃÂ      Pledge for Car decals    Our demonstration unit proves the ability to modify an existing off the shelf ÃÂÃÂ HVAC variable speedÃÂÃÂ compressor with our Soltair expander. At Soltair our plan is to enter the market by partnering with a ÃÂÃÂ proven ÃÂÃÂ HVAC compressor manufacturer so that every HVAC manufacturer can include a powered by Soltair solution inside.

Since then, thousands of people have balloon mapped, and joined the Public Lab network -- tackling new environmental problems, working together, and trying new things.ÃÂÃÂ Our goal is to  greatly expand our worldwide community of people who are equipped, practiced, and ready to document environmental threats, damage, and remediation efforts .  Why we need you  Now we're taking the next step, and in Public Lab tradition, we want to do it collaboratively -- with your help! Our new Mini Balloon and Mini Kite Kits are Prototyping Kits, meaning that there are lots of unresolved questions about how best to use them, and we're looking to you all to  identify, prototype, discuss, and solve these issues . If we can get this new generation of  smaller, lighter, cheaper, and easier  aerial photography kits debugged and ready for anyone to use, our community can reach thousands of new people!   What will you balloon map?   This campaign will help us continue to evolve our aerial mapping tools to make them even more affordable, accessible, and adaptable so that individuals and communities can respond quickly to the issues they see in their environment. It will also help continue to grow a community of researchers, investigators and advocates by providing tools, resources and training to people and organizations facing environmental challenges.ÃÂÃÂ Finally, we'll use the funds to help build out more documentation -- like a how-to video, and the pocket guides and poster below.       REWARDS  The base reward is the much improved Balloon Mapping Kit -- the descendant of the jumbled box of parts from  our original campaign  5 years ago.       As mentioned, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re also launching  two new experimental kits to take this to the next level, with your help . Cameras are getting smaller, lighter, and more affordable, and many people can now use cheaper, smaller balloons and kites to lift these tiny cameras. Read on to learn about our different kits!     Balloon mapping at a stormwater workshop in New Orleans    BALLOON MAPPING KIT  The classic Public Lab Balloon Mapping Kit comes in the iconic suitcase box designed by Nick Chelyapov (read about its  unique design process  here!) and includes:ÃÂÃÂ    1000 feet of stringÃÂÃÂ   5.5 foot weather balloon  canvas gloves  rubber bands, zip-ties, and a carabiner   You add:ÃÂÃÂ    a camera  a soda bottle  helium        MINI BALLOON KIT  The Mini Balloon Kit is based around the 36 inch wide mylar foil balloons  found by contributor Pat Coyle  -- which are much cheaper (as little as $3 each!), and can stay inflated for over a week. They fit in the back seat of your car, or can be taken on the subway. Heck, unlike the big red rubber balloons, they fit through a  doorway . The Mini Balloon Kit is a  Prototyping Kit  and comes with:ÃÂÃÂ    1000 feet of 50 lb string  3 36"" mylar balloons  canvas gloves  rubber bands, zip-ties, and a carabiner   You add:   a lightweight (&lt;100g) camera  helium      Zach from Parts &amp; Crafts takes a balloon through a doorway!    Each can lift about 25 grams -- vs. the classic kitÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s 300+, and a little more if thereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s perfectly calm weather. Instead of renting a helium tank, you can fill them at a floristsÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> shop or party store, and shuttle them to where youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll do your mapping. They also hold up a bit better to sunlight and rough handling, although theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re still delicate. This kit includes everything from the classic Balloon Mapping Kit, but ships with 3 of these mylar balloons, and uses lighter (50 lb test) weight string.ÃÂÃÂ   WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve  collected a list of cameras  light enough to work with 2-3 of these balloons. With a lighter option, that means you'll have a spare balloon.       But there are remaining questions and refinements to make on this kit -- thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re calling it a Prototyping Kit -- and, just like the original Balloon Mapping Kit, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re going to collaboratively work on these issues by sharing knowledge  on the Public Lab website .ÃÂÃÂ   To get involved -- even before the campaign ends -- check out these  Mini Balloon Kit Activities , ask and answer  Questions , and add  your own Stories here .       MINI KITE KIT  The mini kite kit is similar to the mini balloon kit, but ships with a large ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>octopusÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ kite thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a beautiful and stable flyer in medium winds, and packs down into a small nylon bag for easy travel. It wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t fly in as light wind conditions, or carry as much as our  full-size Kite Mapping Pack , but you can throw it in your backpack or in  a Public Lab tote , and honestly the octopus is just a lot of fun to fly. This kit comes with:   1000 feet of 50 lb string  1 large ""octopus"" kite  canvas gloves  rubber bands, zip-ties, and a carabiner   You add:   a lightweight (&lt;100g) camera   Just like the Mini Balloon Kit, this is a  Prototyping Kit  and you'll be collaboratively working on improving it with us at  PublicLab.org :ÃÂÃÂ   To get involved -- even before the campaign ends -- check out these  Mini Kite Kit Activities , ask and answer  Questions , and add your own  stories here .     These lightweight cameras weigh only 58 grams.    LIGHTWEIGHT CAMERAS  Want to try one of the lightweight  GoPro-like cameras Public Labbers have been testing out ? (One survived a fall from 70 feet in its case -- though not recommended!) We're now offering versions of several of our rewards that include this tiny camera, with shockproof + waterproof cases (though that adds a few grams!). Read about our testing with one of these in  this Atlas Obscura article !     A poster ""prototype"" sketch and booklet mockup!    PAPER-BASED REWARDS  Just need the instructions, and want to find your own parts? While the materials list and guides are always  open source on Public Lab's website , this pocket guide includes a rework of our classic  community-produced balloon mapping guide , in a compact and field-notes-ready booklet. Or put the source code on your wall with a fantastic "" how to balloon map "" poster -- final design details to be posted soon.ÃÂÃÂ        USES  People around the world have used the Balloon Mapping Kit and its many variations for all kinds of projects over the past seven years, and hundreds of examples can be found  on the Public Lab site .ÃÂÃÂ        For just a taste of the possibilities, read about projects involving:ÃÂÃÂ     protest-mapping    agriculture    tenure-mapping    wetlands    invasive-species ÃÂÃÂ        4000 maps in MapKnitter.org, on a map     Balloon and kite mapping have been used around the world, for example in:    China    Jerusalem    Taiwan    South Africa    Uganda    Peru    Qatar    Brazil    Colombia    Belize    Canada    Ecuador    UK    Lebanon    Italy    And  so many more !       What about drones?  One question we hear a lot is ""Why don't you just use a drone?"". Our original balloon mapping kit was developed before consumer drones were easily available, and while drones present an interesting range of possibilities, they remain inaccessible and unaffordable to many. That said, we don't think of our aerial mapping tools just as substitutes for commercially produced drones! Public Lab tools are all Open Source, which means that everything can be built, used, modified and shared by anyone who wishes.ÃÂÃÂ   Our aerial mapping tools have been developed by the people that use them, and come with a strong tradition of community support. Do you want to know more about how a design evolved, or are you interested in receiving feedback, or sharing your own ideas and designs? We encourage participation in our onlineÃÂÃÂ spaces and local meetups, where you can collaborate, seek advice, and share successes with a diverse group of people around the world.      Risks and challenges  NOT ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>JUST A STOREÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ  Distributing kits as we do, itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s always a risk that people will think of us as an online business, and not a growing community (and a non-profit) where their involvement is more important than the money they spend. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re doing our best to communicate what weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re about through the story above, but weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re also dedicated to shaping the objects themselves, their boxes and packaging, to communicate this ethos. That said, we've run four successful Kickstarters in this way, and have been distributing tens of thousands of kits around the world for seven years -- so it's not new to us!   TACKLING CHALLENGES TOGETHER  Part of the challenge of Public Lab work in general is to encourage people to share and build things together -- not just things theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve done, but questions they want to ask, concerns they have, and requests for help. Sometimes it can feel like these are impositions on everyone else, but at Public Lab we celebrate them as the very foundation of the collaborative process. Sharing half-completed projects, doubts, and frustrations can help invite others into your work and strengthen it.   Of course, it can also be a challenge to encourage people to report back when they do projects. These projects are about more than ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>toolsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ -- theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re about the stories that come from people adapting, reshaping, and applying them to a thousand different problems or scenarios. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be highlighting many of the stories of peopleÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s amazing work with balloon mapping kits   Finally, these essentials -- engagement in collective brainstorming, troubleshooting, and sharing -- are even more important with the new kits weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re introducing, our Prototyping Kits. These kits have a range of issues and unknowns to tackle, and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re counting on you all to get involved and put them through their paces."

This alternate color scheme for the WhiteFox has anthracite Black keycaps with a matching case, plate, and screws. The accents are a lovely shade of deep red, with just a hint of orange.     The NightFox    The WhiteFox is a new class of mechanical keyboard, a higher quality and more adaptable device than what you are used to. Every key is fully programmable, our software is open source, and the aesthetic is light and elegant. The keycaps are crafted from highly durableÃÂÃÂ  PBT engineering plastics , and the legends are  dye-sublimated  so they will never wear or fade.ÃÂÃÂ The body is solid aluminum, very compact, and can fit on any desk. The rationale behind this keyboard is to provide you with a beautiful piece of functional art that you can customize and fully control.       The WhiteFox is one of our most popular keyboard designs. As such, it has been discussed heavily on forums and covered by many prominent writers, video producers, and news channels.ÃÂÃÂ   Here are extensive reviews, links, and stories about the keyboard:    Deskthority -  The Long Journey of the WhiteFoxÃÂÃÂ      Hardware Canucks (Video) -  The Most Interesting Keyboard Ever?  ÃÂÃÂ     Rhinofeed (Video) -  The WhiteFox Keyboard Review     Techradar -  Here's how I came to spend over $200 on a keyboardÃÂÃÂ      Keychatter -  WhiteFox Review     ExtremeTech -  In Search of Typing Perfection           Our New Switches   We also invented two new types of mechanical keyswitches that are available as options for the WhiteFox. Our goal when inventing these switches was to significantly reduce ""pre-load"" or the initial effort required when you first touch a switch. With this new capability, we were able to recreate the feeling of the most desirable keyboards in the world in a simple mechanical switch.ÃÂÃÂ    Halo True  - A smooth, tactile switch that is effortless to push, and becomes firmer the harder you press it.  View our page to learn more    Halo Clear  - Based on the Halo True architecture, but with a spring weight closer to the very popular Cherry MX Clear.  View our page to learn more    Kaihua Blue  - We didn't invent this switch, but it is a wonderful clicky switch so we included it as an option. It is much louder to type on than the Halo switches, with a short, crisp tactile bump.  View our page to learn more         The Secret Behind Our Keyboards   Designed by the team at  Input Club  in collaboration with  Matteo Spinelli , the  WhiteFox [Vera]  is the latest release in our series of mechanical keyboards. All Input Club products run on the  Keyboard Layout Language  (KLL) we created. KLL is a new type of ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>BIOS for keyboardsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ that allows maximum functionality across Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Inherent to this design are features likeÃÂÃÂ  N-Key Rollover , individual key programming, and custom layouts. This feature setÃÂÃÂ allows you to type accurately at any speed as well as create custom macro options for every key on a hardware level using  our configurator .     Our simple to use, point and click keyboard configurator makes it so that even a novice can customize their keyboard with absolutely no programming knowledge.    Years of experimentation and prototyping went into the development of the WhiteFox and it is filled with small details that make all the difference. For example, the arrow key cluster is slightly separated from the control keys, making it easier to switch from typing to navigating solely by touch. The plate that the mechanical keyswitches are mounted into is the perfect thickness of aluminum to allow slight flex, making your typing experience much easier on your fingers. The height and angle of the case is perfectly optimized to handle both the WhiteFox keycap set as well asÃÂÃÂ  higher profile aftermarket keysets .ÃÂÃÂ        A New Philosophy of Product     The keyboard is low profile, compact, and unnecessary keys have been removed from the WhiteFox. The repetitive act of moving your right hand off the keyboard to use a mouse really adds up when repeated thousands of times a day and smaller keyboards limit this problem. The circuitry is programmable on a hardware level, so if a key you use frequently is not present, you can re-assign any key to fill that function. You can also assign mouse functionality to the WhiteFox, making it so you never have to take your hands off your keyboard.  The most important thing about the WhiteFox is that it is  Open Source . You can download the files to make the WhiteFox from our  Github account . This gives anybody the option to develop individual custom designs or aftermarket modifications for the WhiteFox. Other keyboards are essentially obsolete the moment you receive them but the WhiteFox has an active community behind it that is constantly improving the keyboard. It is likely youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve used open source software, as most of the internet is built upon it, but it is much rarer to encounter open source hardware. Keyboards are hybrid devices which exist in the worlds of both hardware and software. This makes keyboards the perfect vehicle to showcase the beauty and majesty of open source collaboration in a simple tool that you use every day.        Designed To Be Improved   We have produced the WhiteFox keyboard before in  group buys  for keyboard kits that you had to build yourself. Our Kickstarter campaign is for an assembled product that works out of the box. We wanted to make it easier for people outside the engineering community to use the WhiteFox. We think that Kickstarter is the perfect place to achieve this goal. Money raised from this campaign will be used to create a keyboard manufacturing line at a new factory for the WhiteFox.   The components for the WhiteFox are premium quality and cutting edge. It is designed so that the core parts can be made in a machine shop and limited runs can be produced by a small PCB fabricator. This allows the WhiteFox to have a much higher overall quality of craftsmanship than a typical injection molded plastic device. To make one WhiteFox on your own would cost roughly a thousand dollars to produce. This is why we are assembling a large group to help drive the cost down to something more reasonable.        Who We Are   Our team at Input Club is comprised of serious keyboard enthusiasts brought together by online forums. Input Club was founded by  Jacob Alexander , famed keyboard archaeologist and inventor, known as HaaTa on  Geekhack  and  Deskthority . For the WhiteFox, the overall aesthetic and design was created by Matteo Spinelli, the famous mechanical keyboard designer. This version of the WhiteFox comes only in the True Fox layout, and there is a kit option that does not come with mechanical switches.ÃÂÃÂ    Please support our endeavour to bring the WhiteFox to a larger audience!  Our goal is to help make desks everywhere just a little nicer to look at, teaching people why open source matters, and provide you with an exceptional keyboard.We would like to extend special thanks to the fantastic support we've had from our friends, family, and all the kind souls who have lent a hand along the way.

You can learn more about them here - http://crowd.pr                Risks and challenges  We have designed and coordinated many group buys and with the assistance of Massdrop and tens of thousands of our keyboard kits are used around the world. We have not however, shipped a production run as Input Club. To simplify fulfillment, we have focused on a single WhiteFox Layout (the True Fox), and we are offering only three switch options, Halo True (tactile), Halo Clear (tactile firm), and Kaihua Blue (tactile clicky). Limiting available options allows us to make the WhiteFox more affordable and increases the likelihood that we will ship on time.  In addition, this will be the first production run of the fully assembled WhiteFox with a new factory. This factory has been producing high end mechanical keyboards for many years, and is truly aligned with our philosophy. We must recognize, however, new partnerships are always at risk of complication.  Input Club supports other keyboard projects including the K-Type, the Infinity ErgoDox and the Infinity Keyboard."

We believe toys are only as good as the memories they create, which is why we conceived Cubetto as the starting block into a world of magical maps, epic stories, engaging activities, and games.   Here's a handful of ideas...          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Code your way to birdies, eagles, and pars. Extra brownie points for holes in one, and double that for course creativity.        Design a maze  - Flip your world map over and design a mind bending maze with tape. Use logic to find your way out with the blocks. Just don't reach the centre... trust us.        Make him draw  - Grab a blank piece of paper. Strap some felt tips to Cubetto. Unleash your creativity. Draw fractals. Create patterns. Play with geometry and colours.       -  How is this Montessori?   It's non-prescriptive -  Cubetto gives children the ability to think and play within the world they create, giving them freedom to express their own unique ideas and ways to solve problems.   It's child-centered -  All they need to get started is a nudge in understanding that blocks = actions.  Each block is a personal discovery to master the world around them.   It builds resilience -  Solving problems with the blocks is about trial and error. Once a sequence is sent to Cubetto, the result is immediately obvious. If wrong, they can just start again.   It's social - ÃÂÃÂ Playtime with Cubetto is even better with friends. An active way for children to communicate, negotiate and problem-solve over a meaningful, tangible experience.       -  How is this coding?   Algorithms -  Algorithms are sets of precise instructions. The blocks are a physical representation of specific instructions, and once compiled, form an actual algorithm children can touch.   The Queue -  Instructions in programs are executed following precise orders. In other words, an intentional sequence of instructions, or a queue, represented by the Board's wavy line.   Debugging -  The instructions are laid on the Board, and are immediately executed by Cubetto, so when he doesn't arrive where he should, fixing mistakes is as easy as swapping a block.   Recursions -  Create a subroutine by ""packing"" a sequence in the function line, and call it in the queue with a blue block when you need it. Make long sequences shorter, and more efficient.       -  Cubetto in education  Cubetto comes with over  120 curriculum-mapped lesson plans , fit for education programs all over the world.ÃÂÃÂ Cubetto is the easiest way to introduce computer programming in early years learning.  From Montessori, to Common Core, to Coding Clubs, to STEM programs, Cubetto has been used in schools across 96 countries and counting.

ÃÂÃÂ -  Award-winning design  Honoured with Gold Cannes Lions, Red-Dot Design Awards and MoMA exhibitions, Cubetto is more than a great educational toy. It's a little piece of design history. Something we hope you'll gift to your children, and that your children will one day gift to theirs.        Why coding for 3-year-olds?   Much like playing with Cubetto, computational thinking is about breaking down tasks into a logical sequence of steps to reach an objective.ÃÂÃÂ In fact, computational thinking is something we do every day to solve all kinds of problems, big and small.  Thinking about the world around us the same way we think in the world of Cubetto is empowering.ÃÂÃÂ It gives us the confidence to try things out, break the rules, and shape our environment. Which is pretty amazing!  Playtime with Cubetto is collaborative, because you learn that complicated tasks are best tackled by more than one person.ÃÂÃÂ It encourages creativity by showing you there is no right or wrong way to reach your objectives and make the impossible possible.  Who are you people?  We've gone from 2 founders in an apartment to a community of thousands. 4 years ago we decided to make coding in early years our mission. We never changed our minds. We're parents, dreamers, and creators...   This is our story...          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

We've been here before, on 2 separate occasions. In 2013, to successfully finance Cubetto's development, and in 2016 to successfully launch Cubetto at scale. Today we're back for a third time to make Cubetto's world bigger, brighter, bolder, by launching two brand new Adventure Packs.  When we first came to Kickstarter in 2013 we didn't just find a platform to fund a project. We found a home, and we found a community. We found a new, honest, and transparent way to connect our products directly to those who need them. We wouldn't have it any other way.       -  A small part in a big play  Our world is changing. What our children needed yesterday isn't necessarily what they will need tomorrow, but innovation doesn't always mean disregarding tradition.  If the present is a wall, with past and future on either side, we can only stand on the broad shoulders of those who came before us to peer confidently at what comes next.ÃÂÃÂ   The field of education technology is a relay race. Each previous innovator passing the baton of progress to the next. We just happen to be in the right place, at the right time.  Small as we are, we love what we do, because it makes us feel part of a much bigger mission. Join us again, and like us you can be part of something much bigger too.       Thank you!

Play                                      Replay with sound          Play with   sound                   00:00    00:00                                             The resulting efficiency boost means savings of 20-38% on your cooling bills. ÃÂÃÂ Savings are due to two factors, 1) decreased power consumption while the AC is running, and 2) increased capacity in hot conditions which brings really long cycles back down into normal time ranges.       ÃÂÃÂ        Worried about installation? Don't be. Mistbox attaches to your AC unit in minutes. In just a few steps, you can hook up Mistbox and start saving money. You don't need any special tools, either. A simple screwdriver will do the trick.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Many customers ask us about water treatment. Mistbox has developed a custom water treatment system to ensure the fine misting can not damage the AC unit.  The patent pending method kills bacteria on contact and treats metal surfaces to make algae or mold growth an impossibility. The method also neutralizes dissolved solids (hardness) in the water so they cannot tightly adhere to the condenser fins.  The Mistbox filters have been designed to work with municipal water anywhere in the continental US.ÃÂÃÂ   Take a closer look at our water treatment filter and see for yourself.ÃÂÃÂ         The Best Of The Best   Since water treatment is such an important topic, Mistbox enlisted top water treatment expert Owen Boyd to help us get it right. Owen entered the world of environmental remediation in 1988 and developed a patented technology for the removal of carbon dioxide from combined cycle power plants. He later commercialized this technology for Dow Chemical. Owen's journey in water treatment started in 1992, and he has brought several new technologies to market:ÃÂÃÂ     Developed chelating mercury removal resin to reduce mercury emissions from incinerators and coal burning power plants.    Developed a mercury removal system for dental waste discharge, which is used internationally by thousands of dental clinics.     In partnership with LeHigh University, developed a regenerable arsenic removable media that is used in many U.S. municipal systems and thousands of U.S. homes.     Developed patent pending system for removal of solids from high TDS water.ÃÂÃÂ     Developed a patent pending process linking ozone with quantum catalyst  technology for disinfection of water used in medical applications.ÃÂÃÂ     Needless to say, he knows his stuff. He was also awarded a Technology Innovator Award from the EPA in 1996, among many other accolades and recognition.  So you can feel confident that the Mistbox water treatment system is the best of the best.            ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        We want world peace. And clean air.  Neither are easy tasks to undertake, but we decided to focus on clean air. Mistbox started its journey in 2013, with a hairy, audacious goal: take expensive evaporative cooling technology that has been around commercially for decades, and cultivate this into technology that is both impactful and affordable for homeowners (and the planet!). There were lots of unknowns along the way, but we were guided by our passion and overwhelming desire to make a difference.  The result is a solution that requires little-to-no effort, while delivering even greater savings than many of the category leaders in our space. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a win for consumers. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a win for the planet. We are proud to be the engineers, designers, developers and dreamers behind it.  Meet Mistbox.

Challenges are common for all hardware projects when taking a product from a few prototypes to thousands of units a day. The good news is that the Mistbox team has over 40 years experience designing and manufacturing consumer electronics. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve also already produced 2 different versions of Mistbox and have put thousands of units into the marketplace.  That being said, manufacturing new products is always tricky so below weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll touch on the two largest risks that could cause delays:  Supply Chain Issues: At the end of the day, a consumer product is only as good as the quality of its components. Mistbox has partnered with FLEX, the 2nd largest contract manufacturer in the world, to manage our supply chain. However, if a selected supplier experiences lead time or quality issues, our production timeline may be at risk of delays.  Certifications: Certifications are an important part of ensuring that your Mistbox has met all legal requirements and is safe to use. Mistbox will have to go through testing for both FCC and CE markings. These tests must be done on a nearly finalized Mistbox device. Since failure of any of the certifications would result in a redesign process, it would add significant delays to shipment. This is an unlikely scenario.  WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re confident weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve assembled the right team and partners to ship Mistbox with minimal delays. Should we experience hiccups throughout the production process, we promise to keep our backers informed with timely updates.   WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re super excited and hope you will join us on this journey!"

As a bonus, we show students how to build a Weather app for iOS. As such, students develop an understanding for the differences between coding for Android and iOS. ÃÂÃÂ        Websites often display content in multiple blocks. In Level 2, students build such a website using divs. Students can then rearrange and manipulate the divs into their own design to make varying websites. ÃÂÃÂ        Mammoth Interactive courses are different from others you might find because we show you how to make both the code and the art for your game. We set up a scene and implement its functionality in Unity. Then we make the game's models (art assets) in Photoshop, Illustrator, or Blender.ÃÂÃÂ        Neural networks are a more advanced coding concept. The gist is: you can pass data through a neural network to make predictions about future results.  Start with free online editors. ÃÂÃÂ   You can use free online editors follow along with the projects we make in Hello Coding. Here are some of the tools you'll learn: ÃÂÃÂ        In Level 4, you build 3 casual games in Unity. Unity is a free program that can export games to consoles, computers, and mobile phones.ÃÂÃÂ   In Level 4, you make a Flappy Bird game clone and its pixel art in Photoshop. You make an Angry Birds game clone and its vector art in Illustrator. You make a 3D Ping Pong game with an AI and its art in Blender.ÃÂÃÂ        In Level 5, you learn how to use Python, Google's main coding language, to automate repetitive tasks like account collection or image sorting. Neural networks are a technique with Python that we use to predict the stock market.       C# is the language used to make scripts in Unity. In Level 4, we use scripts to implement the functionality of games. With scripts, you can customize a game's behavior and enable the game to respond to user interaction.       In Level 3, you learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the three programming languages everyone begins with when learning how to code. Our instructors use JSBin.com to show coding examples. JSBin is a free site where you can watch your code create a website in real time.  See your course outlines below: ÃÂÃÂ        Level 1 begins with an explanation of the Mammoth Interactive teaching model. We value reviewing past concepts and connecting them to new knowledge rather than cramming and then forgetting.  Then you learn how programming languages have evolved to produce the most commonly used ones today. You get access to the Mammoth Forum, where you can connect with other students at Mammoth Interactive.ÃÂÃÂ        Level 2 is all about web development. First you become familiar with the 3 primary web languages: HTML, CCS, and JavaScript. You apply your knowledge by building a landing page and modular website alongside your instructor. By completing Level 2, you will have a site that you can easily manipulate to design websites for yourself or clients!       By completing Level 3, you can call yourself an App Developer.ÃÂÃÂ We use the Java language to make an app for the web. Java is a general-purpose language that is based on classes.  HTML5 is a language that structures and presents content on the web. We use HTML5 to make an app for Android phones. Swift is Apple's programming language. As a bonus tutorial, we show you how to use Swift and Xcode to make an app for the iPhone.       By completing Level 4, you have four programs that you can put on your resume: Unity3D, Photoshop, Blender3D, and Illustrator.ÃÂÃÂ   Unity3D is a free app that allows you to make 2D and 3D games.ÃÂÃÂ Photoshop is a user-friendly application. It can be used for nearly every kind of image editing, including editing photos and making graphics.ÃÂÃÂ   Blender3D is an intuitive interface with which you can make high-quality, 2D and 3D art even if you can't draw.ÃÂÃÂ Illustrator is the most popular computer application for making vector graphics. With Illustrator, you can make high-resolution logos, typography, icons, and more.       In Level 5, you learn how to navigate Python and its frameworks with practical examples. Python is a user-friendly coding language that is famous for its versatility. Among others, Youtube, Facebook, and Artificial Intelligence all use Python.ÃÂÃÂ TensorFlow is a system that represents data computations as graphs.ÃÂÃÂ   This is real coding for all ages.     Anyone can code.    We design our tutorials for people with NO EXPERIENCE. In a Mammoth Interactive curriculum, you get as much useful information as possible from every minute.ÃÂÃÂ No longer do you need to spend time putting together knowledge from YouTube videos.

""HI,I already bought one device - but now I want to buy another 10. I missed the 2nd project which ended today. Please let me know how I can buy another 10 devices.Thanks""   Why are we starting this project?    For global marketing  It is very difficult for small start-up companies to create new products and promote them to global markets. If a company is cost-effective or has global presence, it's easy, but there's a lot of risk for small start-ups. Kickstarter is a very large and reputable site, and there are supporters who are interested in the products of the start-up company. If small start-up companies can get the support and interest of their sponsors, it will be a great help for them to succeed.   Securing funds for product mass production and future product development  Kick starter supports funding based on the trust of our sponsors. These funds can be used as sales forecasts for products and as promotional material for start-up companies. And funds from sponsors will help start-up companies produce products reliably and research / develop next products.        ÃÂÃÂ What is AnyTouch Blue?    Configuration of the product  AnyTouch Blue is a product consisting of a USB Dongle and an Android app or iOS app.   AnyTouch Blue USB Dongle H/W  The USB Dongle is composed of a HID USB module and BLE module. It can be operated with a wireless keyboard and mouse if you plug it into the USB port of a HID USB supporting device (PC, MAC, Linux, Android, PS, XBOX etc.).   AnyTouch Blue App (Android or iOS)  The app can control AnyTouch Blue USB Dongle HW wirelessly. It is installed on smart devices using Android or iOS (Apple iPhone, Apple iPad, Google Nexus, Google Pixel, etc.). App can be used repeatedly with an one-time installation.        ÃÂÃÂ Where and how does it use?    For presentations  It can control all functions of Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple keynote, Prezi and Adobe PDF Viewer wirelessly. You can make an impressive presentation using AnyTouch Blue as a mouse and keyboard. It can be used conveniently for lectures or educational purposes.          Wireless controller for smart TV, STB  In order to use all functions of a smart TV and STB, all functions of mouse and keyboard should be available. AnyTouch Blue can use all the functions of various types of mouse devices (touch mouse, air mouse) and all the functions of a keyboard for desktop PC. You can also use the shortcut function to perform complex key functions with one touch.          Wireless controller for supporting HID USB devices such as PC, Mac  AnyTouch Blue can be operated when connected to a device that supports a HID USB device. Typical devices that support HID USB devices are PCs, Macs, Linux, Android devices, etc. AnyTouch Blue can be used to remotely control them.        Why should we use it?    Same usage as USB Flash Drive  Smartphones have become popular and there are many useful apps for controlling PCs, Macs, etc. with smartphones. However, in order for these apps to work, a server program must be installed on a PC or Mac.If you change the PC and Mac you want to control, you need to reinstall it.AnyTouch Blue is a device that works just like a USB Flash Drive. Do not be stressed by installing programs anymore.          Easy and fast connection  AnyTouch Blue uses Bluetooth LE, but it is very fast and easy to use by using dedicated protocol.You can connect and use the app in just a few seconds after launch.        Compare with other products    Specification          ÃÂÃÂ  Price         ÃÂÃÂ Project trusty    Trusty of AnyTouch Blue Dongle HW  AnyTouch Blue Dongle HW has obtained the following certifications through its accredited certification body. They were no problems while producing . Also there havenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t been any problem since on sales.          Apps are registered on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store  The control app for AnyTouch Blue has already been run on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. It has been field tested by many users to ensure stability. In addition, due to the Apple App Store regulations, apps that control the hardware must be FCC-certified to be sent to Apple headquarters before being tested for reliability.          Ready for mass production  R &amp; D on products and mass production of products are very different contents. One reason why many Kickstarter projects fail is that they have the know-how in research and development, but they do not have the know-how regarding mass production. This project is fully prepared for mass production (SMT, die, assembly, packing, etc.). It can be commercialized and sold at any time.          Know-how for Global delivery  In order to deliver the finished product globally, knowledge of both is required. We have global shipments for the field test and promotion of our developed products, and we have the know-how.   Key features of AnyTouch Blue    Touchpad function  The touch function of the smart device can perform the same operation as the mouse or touch pad.          Keyboard function  In addition to mobile keyboards, you can use all the same keys as desktop keyboards.        ÃÂÃÂ     Air mouse function  If you move the smart device in space, it can operate the same as the air mouse.        ÃÂÃÂ     Digitizer function  It supports the absolute coordinate system of the digitizer, not just the relative coordinate system such as the mouse.   ÃÂÃÂ          Hotkey function  With the hotkey function, it is possible to execute various actions with one touch.        ÃÂÃÂ     Media control function  It can easy control Youtube, Netflix and more.        ÃÂÃÂ     Joypad function  You can play games using the joypad function.        ÃÂÃÂ     Timer function  The Timer feature helps the presenter's sense of time during a presentation. AnyTouch Blue will also alert you when there is 1 minute left.        Hardware specifications       Product package       Reward                 Product shipping plan  It will shipped sequentially from the end of Jul 2017. (Delivery will begin as soon as payment is confirmed in the kickstarter)  Who are we?    A company to make new and fun IT devices  3IWare is a very small company established to create new and funny IT devices. We are not a very talented company, but I want to be a company that can make small ideas come true and permeate your life.            Risks and challenges  * Spend a lot of cost for AnyTouch Blue development  We have already spent over USD 200,000 to develop the AnyTouch Blue product as a small startup company. We want to develop more powerful IT devices in the future, and we need to raise money.  * Securing mass production cost of AnyTouch Blue products  As we said before, we spent a lot of money on developing AnyTouch Blue products, and it costs more to mass-produce and sell our products. In order to operate and sell the company continuously, securing stable funds is a top priority. If you have the warm support of many patrons, it will be very helpful to us.  * To create new and fun products  To create a new and fun product, a startup company is always asking for your help to make it possible.

When we reach $12,500, all backers with a fur child (dog or cat) contributing poop for science will get a free tee (sized for pups, children, guy or girl, man or woman, your choice).    We invite YOU and your DOG to participate in a citizen science study of the doggy microbiome ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093>ÃÂÃÂ brought to you by the creators of  KittyBiome .   This project will help us to better understand how microbiomes differ among dogs. We need all kinds of dogs to participate - big and small, all kinds of breeds and mixes, healthy and sick.       Two years ago, we launched a Kickstarter campaign for our KittyBiome project that enabled us to create the largest database on the microbiome, diet, health, and lifestyle of pet cats. Because of this project, we are now well on our way to developing diagnostics and therapies to improve the health and wellness of cats. Now we want to do the same for dogs.   Please join us to help further scientific research to improve our understanding of the roles played by gut microbes in dog health and behavior!ÃÂÃÂ    What is the microbiome?  The microbiome is composed of all the bacteria, fungi, and other tiny things that live in and on us and our dogs. These microbial communities differ between ears and noses and mouths and tummies.        This project focuses on characterizing bacteria living in the gut microbiome of dogs. Beneficial gut bacteria help your pet digest food, make vitamins, communicate with the immune and nervous systems, fight off infections, and more.  How can you help?  Actually, it's easier than you think.ÃÂÃÂ We all spend a lot of time picking up our pet's poop. While we usually rush to the trash can, this poop contains valuable information about your dog's gut microbiome that could be used to advance canine science.       By 'giving a crap', your dog can help us answer such questions asÃÂÃÂ whether dog breeds differ in their composition of gut bacteria,ÃÂÃÂ whether raw or kibble diets affect bacterial diversity,ÃÂÃÂ how domestic dogs differ from wolves, as well as potentially help us find solutions for suffering pets!       Does your dog have golden poo?ÃÂÃÂ   We are looking for healthy dogs with fantastic gut microbiomes. In order to develop better solutions for sick dogs, we need to know what the microbiome looks like in healthy dogs, who have good bacterial diversity and a nice representation of beneficial bacteria that fight inflammation and help with digestion. We refer to poop from these dogs as ""golden poo.""       Celebrity pups  We are inviting celeb dogs to join the project, so we can see how our dogs' microbiomes compare to the rich and instafamous. We are very pleased to announce that Atka, a wolf ambassador and three of his friends from the NY Wolf Conservation Center have all agreed to contribute poop to canine science. You can reach Atka by email: Atka@nywolf.org and follow him on Twitter @nywolforg     Atka is pleased to contribute poop to help her canine cousins.    Who we areÃÂÃÂ   Holly Ganz is a microbial ecologist who studies how microbes and mammals interact. She has sampled poop from many wild carnivores, including lions, leopards, cheetahs, and African wild dogs. After creating KittyBiome in 2015, she realized that digestive disorders are common in cats and dogs and that the microbiome plays an important role in some of these conditions. And so sheÃÂÃÂ founded AnimalBiome in September 2016 in order to create better diagnostics and therapeutics for cats and dogs. Holly received her PhD from UC Davis and conducted research at UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, and the UC Davis Genome Center.     Holly collecting samples from an African Wild Dog in Namibia.    Kari Goodman is an evolutionary biologist turned data scientist whose field research on biodiversity has taken her from deep in the floodplain forests of the Amazon to the highest volcanoes in Hawaii. In addition to receiving her PhD from and performing postdoctoral research at UC Berkeley, she is also a graduate of the Insight Data Science Fellows Program.ÃÂÃÂ      Kari collecting samples in Hawaii.    Holly and Kari met at UC Berkeley over a decade ago and are thrilled to be working together on the amazing microbial diversity living inside animals.ÃÂÃÂ        OurÃÂÃÂ  Scientific Advisory Board  includes Professors  Jonathan Eisen  of UC Davis,  Jennifer Gardy  of the University of British Columbia, and  Stan Marks  of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.ÃÂÃÂ   About our rewards  Here is more information about the great rewards that we have put together for this campaign.ÃÂÃÂ Please note that the microbiome assessment we provide as a reward is not a diagnostic test but rather a description of the bacteria living in your dog.ÃÂÃÂ        How it works  When you sign up to contribute dog poop for science, we will send you a sample kit with instructions for how to collect a fecal sample (yes, that means poop) back to us.       How we will sequence the samples  We will perform ultra-high-throughput microbial community analysis using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Bacterial taxa present in the samples will be identified by sequencing the V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA.        Sequencing will be performed with minor modifications following the protocols of the  Earth Microbiome Project . DNA will be extracted from samples using the QIAGEN PowerFecal Kit with bead beating. DNA concentrations will be standardized across all samples for PCR enrichment and library preparation. The resulting libraries will be sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq (paired-end 250 base pair sequencing) following standard protocols.Bacterial species will be identified using Quantitative Insights in Microbial Ecology (QIIME) and mothur, and other programs. We will assess differences in microbiome diversity using various multivariate methods in R. Results will be presented in an interactive website that we developed for this project.       Please follow the DoggyBiome project on  Twitter  and  Facebook .  Thank you and woof!      Risks and challenges  It takes 4-6 weeks to receive results from your pup's poop sample. In addition, it may take a while to connect what we learn about the dog microbiome from this project to specific features of dogs like their health, personalities, or lifestyles. Initially we need to describe the dog microbiome and see how much variation is observed. This is a long term project that will greatly benefit from the contributions of citizen scientists."

ÃÂÃÂ        Hi, IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m Alex.Me and my team are avid golfers. We love the game and have been producing golf push carts for more than 18 years. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve made more than a million on the market under different brands. All we think about are golf and golf carts, nothing else.  But as we were making all these carts as an OEM, we were seeing a huge lack of innovation in the space.  Golf carts are big, bulky, and expensive, while golf bags and pushcarts were unwieldy and tiresome. We wanted something affordable that would ease the burden of carrying or pushing our equipment everywhere while still being able to walk and enjoy the course.  So we created eWheels. And...we love it! WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve been using it since itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s creation and wondered why we didnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t do this sooner.

We believe in reproduction of music to be heard as if you are in front of a music concert or music studio.  We found that Beryllium has been used in home audio speakers for a couple of decades.  It was never really used for small earphones.  Once we created these small single dynamic driver earphones, we tested our earphones through frequency testing and distortion testing.We hope you become part of the Starbrick Team and help us bring the Be4 earphones into your music world.  Let Starbrick Be4 earphones be your new standard for your listening experience.",1.0,2017-03-01 15:31:05 -0500,Backed 0 projects,"Los Angeles, CA",45,"ÃÂÃÂ    The Starbrick Be4 Earphones were created to enhance the quality of audio earphones. Bringing you music that sounds natural, as if it was being played live right in front of you, from the instruments themselves.   The mission of Starbrick Be4 is to deliver high fidelity audio by harnessing the technology of Beryllium. What is Beryllium? ""Beryllium""ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¼<U+008C>it's Number 4 metal element on Periodic table. Atomic weight is 9.012182.Also it is the lightest metal element in Alkaline earth metal elements.ÃÂÃÂ  Since Be4 is the periodic element for Beryllium, we thought it was the perfect name for the Starbrick Be4 Earphones. Known as the fourth lightest metal element, and four times stronger than steel, Beryllium allows for a more coherent, powerful sound. Unlike other metals commonly used in earphones, Beryllium diaphragm speakers continue to provide warm and full sound up to 16 KHz. So, with the Starbrick Be4 Earphones, you can listen to music in itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s authentic form, straight from the studio.   StarBrick Be4 earphones are limited to a production run of 3000 pieces.  Each earphone comes with a hand numbered certificate of authenticity card.         What makes StarBrick Be4 Earphones different   One of the problems with earphones on the market is that construction of the earbuds if using cheap materials. When manufactures that use plastic parts and cheap diaphragms and generic drivers, delivering you muddy sounds and distortion at its highest volume.  The Starbrick Be4 earphones consist of an aluminum casing that is CNC machined on each individual piece.ÃÂÃÂ  The back casing is made of natural dark wood, therefore we combine both casing to bring the sturdy feel and look to these amazing earphones.ÃÂÃÂ  The other integral part of this earphone is the single dynamic Beryllium diaphragm within the casing.ÃÂÃÂ    We all want to experience clear, high quality sound without distortion. Knowing that feeling of being front-row at a concert, hearing the music as it comes alive and rocks with clarity with lush sounds.ÃÂÃÂ    With Starbrick Be4, there are no software effects that enhance the audio. Just the pure quality of the music, as it was mastered in the recording studio, unlocked by the Beryllium earphones.   3D Diaphragm          Frequency Ranges    The Highs   When you listen to high hat with the Starbrick Be4ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s, you donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t get the harsh sounds that can be piercing with a metallic tizzy. The guitar volume swells. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s smooth and fast at the same time.  The sounds of the cymbals are aggressive. The music comes alive and rings with clarity. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    The Mid Range    With midrange, you want to hear the silky soft sounds. The Starbrick Be4 lets you hear the definition of each instrument used in a song, feeling the physical impression of the instrumentsÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> true sound.  YouÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re able to hear and identify the sweet, velvety voices and distinguish the smooth piano keys from all of your favorite artists.ÃÂÃÂ    The Bass    Bass performance is the most misunderstood aspect of reproduced sound. The popular belief is that the more bass, the better. This is reflected in ads for ""subwoofers"" that promise things like ""earthshaking bass."" What matters to the true music lover isn't quantity of bass, but the quality. The Be4 Earphones bring you the highest quality and best reproduction bass through our dynamic driver. You will hear the balanced bass.   Why do so many people in the world buy headphones and earphones?   The majority of users are listening to enjoy music. There are no economic factors as to why people use headphones or earphones.  Surveys tell us that music makes us happy, more productive, and better focused. So are we satisfied with sub par sounds from low-quality, high-priced audio equipment? LetÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s stand together, and demand more from the world we experience through our audio products.

DRR USA is a manufacturer of ATVs headquartered in Brunswick, Ohio. For nearly twenty years, DRR has provided safe ATVs to kids all over the United States. DRRÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s customers have over 99 National Championships under their belts in TT, motocross, flat-track, and cross-country racing. With products approved by the American Motorcycle Association, DRR provides a variety of CPSC compliant vehicles from youth to adult.",1.0,2018-10-29 16:20:30 -0400,Backed 0 projects,"Cleveland, OH",KO,"DRR USA is proud to reveal the Stealth Electric ATV (E-ATV), a battery powered unit that offers a smooth, silent riding experience. This prototype Electric ATV is the first adult all-terrain vehicle of its kind. Most other electric all-terrain vehicles are small, can only travel short distances, and are made for children. Comparable in size to a 600cc adult utility four wheeler and comparable in power to a 300cc four wheeler, the DRR Stealth was developed to support search and rescue personnel, ecologists, environmentalists, hobbyists, and recreationalists. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a vehicle capable of assisting in the field, all without releasing carbon dioxide into the environment.             SEARCH AND RESCUEÃÂÃÂ    During search and rescue hearing cries for help is difficult over the loud noise of gas-powered units. The DRR Stealth Electric ATV is  completely silent  providing rescue workers with a potential life saving advantage.   ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITSÃÂÃÂ    The DRR Stealth has significant environmental benefits  eliminating both carbon emissions and noise pollution . A standard ATV can release over 120 pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere with a single tank of gas. It can also clock in at approximately 80 on a decibel meter. The Stealth Electric ATV is both clean and silent.ÃÂÃÂ         APPEARANCE                              BATTERY LIFE / REMOVAL   ÃÂÃÂ Replacing the battery takes less than three minutes and requires no heavy lifting.                            To charge the DRR Stealth Electric ATV plug it into any three-prong outlet. It has a quick 6-hour charging period to get back on the trail faster. The 72 volt, 4-kilowatt lithium ion battery is not only lighter, but it charges quicker, supports a charge longer, is less harmful and can tolerate colder temperatures compared to traditional lead acid batteries.ÃÂÃÂ    As technology advances, DRR hopes to improve battery charge as well as develop solar powered charging stations.ÃÂÃÂ      DISTANCEÃÂÃÂ    Traveling up to 35 miles at maximum speed uphill with a single battery pack, an eight-hour day of intermittent work is completely possible without recharging. An optional second battery pack can extend the range up to 65 miles.    DIGITAL DASHÃÂÃÂ                              A full easy to read digital dashboard provides the rider with all essential information at a glance. The dashboard has an odometer, speedometer, and a battery charge indicator.   HANDLING   Steering is easy with the DRR Stealth ATV. The unit requires  no shifting  while the gearless system provides linear and consistent power on most terrains.    SAFETY                             Daytime running lights, light up dark wooded areas. Brake lights inform the rider behind the E-ATV to slow down or stop. When the brakes are applied, the electric motor shuts down. This prevents damage to the motor and saves energy so the battery charge can last longer.ÃÂÃÂ    Turn-Signal development is in progress.ÃÂÃÂ      BRAKES   Four disc-brakes mean twice the stopping power. Decreasing downhill speed is easy with the newer wave rotors that expel dirt, grass, and other debris. This allows the braking system to perform better while doubling the brake pad life.   ÃÂÃÂ  RACKSÃÂÃÂ         The front racks can carry a load of up to 125 pounds while the rear racks can carry up to 240 pounds.    SUSPENSIONÃÂÃÂ AND SHOCKS ÃÂÃÂ        Dual a-arm suspension eliminates bump steer and makes for a smoother ride. The shocks in front and rear will reduce fatigue and provide a more comfortable experience. Adjust the shocks with five adjustable pre-load settings, variable spring rate, and extended travel.    GROUND CLEARANCE   The Stealth Electric ATV has 12 inches of ground clearance. More ground clearance means tackling tougher terrain with ease. The smooth bottom chassis glides over obstacles and debris.    DIMENSIONS         FOOT WELLS AND FOOT PEGSÃÂÃÂ    Completely enclosed footwells keep the rider's feet where they belong while protecting them from sticks and other objects. Nerf bars can be risky and cause the tire to grab the riderÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s foot and jerk them from the ATV, the DRR StealthÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s foot well design eliminates that risk. Included for rescue personnel is a special foot peg that allows a second rider to sit behind the driver without interfering with their foot space.        At DRR, the things we care most about are family, environment, and providing the best product we possibly can for our customers.  The owner of DRR USA originally created the company after experiencing an ATV accident involving her youngest son. At the time, children's ATVs did not always have proper safety features. They were too narrow and often tipped over. To solve the safety issues, she decided to develop an ATV she thought would help protect her family while they enjoyed their favorite hobby. The result was a wider ATV, with slip-resistant seats, a safety tether, brake lights, daytime running lights, and fully enclosed floorboards.ÃÂÃÂ   That vision took off and ultimately created DRR USA, a small business headquartered in Brunswick, Ohio. For nearly twenty years, DRR has provided safe ATVs to kids all over the United States. Our customers have over 99 National Championships under their belts in TT, motocross, flat-track, and cross-country racing. While DRR is proud of its history, we are branching out into new territory with the electric ATV while still offering  family adventure, lifetime memories, and passion for the outdoors.

ÃÂÃÂ We have been involved in the SUP industry since its infancy. LightSUP Boards was born from the mind of an ingenious girl who was tenacious in her pursuit to make her board a reality! ÃÂÃÂ Mask on, face hanging over the board looking at the fish below year after year was our break time ritual. ÃÂÃÂ On a summer day in the shack while replacing the VU window in a boogie board, this 11 year old watching suddenly asks, ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Dad why canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t we put a window in a SUP so I can look at the fish and paddle at the same time?ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a very good questionÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦. Maybe we should try.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ A few weeks later, she asked if we could work on a design. ÃÂÃÂ We did, and that was that! ÃÂÃÂ   It wasnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t until after an abysmal summer rental season in 2017 that we realized, if we were going to continue making a living by stoking out guests on the ocean we needed a change. ÃÂÃÂ We needed her board to become a reality. ÃÂÃÂ After a year in development and several prototypes later, we tested our first prototype in February 2018. ÃÂÃÂ In October 2018, we began our Proof of Concept by starting a LightSUP guided tour on the Big Island @lightsuphawaii. ÃÂÃÂ We have been overwhelmed by the response weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve gotten by our Ohana, guests, passer byes, and our Social Media Ohana! ÃÂÃÂ        We realize that a Window SUP is nothing new. ÃÂÃÂ We realize Glow SUP is nothing new. ÃÂÃÂ We realize the brilliance of combing the two. ÃÂÃÂ This is not new either. ÃÂÃÂ What is new, is our version of the two, THE most technologically advanced SUP ever made! ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ELEMENTS OF THE EVOLUTION  THE WINDOW  Our expansive, dual pane window system is symmetrically designed to provide the paddler with maximum peripheral viewing. ÃÂÃÂ The window in intricately positioned to provide the paddler with line of sight viewing from the standing paddling position. The massive viewing area allows for simultaneous viewing by a passenger and paddler. ÃÂÃÂ The Marine Grade, Polycarbonate window panes are UV protected. ÃÂÃÂ A scratch protective film ensures clear viewing paddle after paddle.       THE LIGHTS  Our Nightlight Model has three internal light ports that are strategically positioned to maximize illumination of the area surrounding the board while concentrating the lumens to the line of sight view of the paddler. ÃÂÃÂ The ports are compatible withÃÂÃÂ multiple high power water proof led lights available. ÃÂÃÂ The port system allows for ease of removal for charging andÃÂÃÂ replaceability forÃÂÃÂ extended paddling. ÃÂÃÂ We have a strategic partnership with LumeCube.ÃÂÃÂ        THE CONSTRUCTIONÃÂÃÂ   We employ an entirely unique SUP construction process that creates the lightweight, hard board you would expect from a traditional epoxy construction, but with unparalleled impact resistance and durability. We infuse our thermoplastic resin into fiberglass cloth, through a thermoforming process. Thermal Composite TechnologyÃÂÃÂ is an evolutionary, clean construction process that makes our boards one of the most ecoÃÂÃÂ conscious Stand Up Paddle Boards on the market. ÃÂÃÂ Our boards are made to last season after season after season!       These are the some of elements that encompasses our claim. ÃÂÃÂ Our boards have a retractable handle for ease of transportation and can also be used to lock up. ÃÂÃÂ Our boards have a quick release fin system for ease of storage and transportation. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        LightSUP Boards is far more than a fancy Stand Up Paddle Board.ÃÂÃÂ  On a personal level, it is the culmination of the collective efforts of my Ohana working to make a young woman's dream become a reality.ÃÂÃÂ  The lessons sheÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s learned and the knowledge sheÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s gained by this experience are truly priceless and will pay dividends far beyond this company.ÃÂÃÂ  We truly could not be more proud for getting this far.ÃÂÃÂ  Along our journey, we could not help but focus on this being an opportunity to enhance the experience of the avid Stand Up Paddler, as well as attract those whoÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve never yet been inspired to try SUP.ÃÂÃÂ        As Michael Franti prophetically says ""Do it for the love, not for the money."" ÃÂÃÂ This is how many live in the Aloha State, loving life while hustling to make ends meet. ÃÂÃÂ Our Ohana is no different, making a living doing things we love, but just getting by. ÃÂÃÂ The truth is, we have put all of our meager savings into this dream and lack the financial where with all to take LightSUP Boards from custom made boards to production boards to meet the potential demand of the future. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Aloha! ÃÂÃÂ We are LightSUP Boards, an evolutionary Stand Up Paddle Board Company from the Big Island of Hawaii.ÃÂÃÂ  We are hoping to raise $25,000 to increase our production capabilities and share our Stand Up Paddle Board with Aloha with our ocean Ohana just like you. ÃÂÃÂ            Risks and challenges  When you're a little fish swimming in a big pond, seldom do you get priority in production queues.  There is a potential for delay in delivery, however our highest priority is delivering our evolutionary SUP to our LightSUP Ohana on time.  We have made the choice to offer a small quantity run to ensure we deliver on our pledge!"

Recent Testimonials   ""The Leita Teuton is the first of its kind watch that contains both an elegant look, while also ÃÂÃÂ having great functionality that people actually use. The mobile app for many smartwatch devices is not user friendly and difficult to navigate, but this mobile app is simple and easy to use for all types of people.""   -Tom GilbergÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ   ""I love the look of classic analog watches but would find the extra digital capabilities extremely useful without having to charge it every day. Finally the smartwatch that takes care of everything! Everything about the features that excite me. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    -Roberto Weiner  ÃÂÃÂ   ""This looks like a much better idea than a ""smartwatch"" that just duplicates my phone and needs constant recharging. This watch packs both great software and hardware into a seamless design, along with a cool mobile app. Lastly, the Leita Tueton is sleek, but does not have a typical smartwatch look.""  - Tom Anderson  ÃÂÃÂ   ""I love smart technology and I also love good mobile apps. I've been let down by terrible battery life in the smartwatches I have owned so far. To have a watch with a decent battery life makes all the difference when traveling as I often don't have any ability to charge my devices.""   -Carla Samuels  ÃÂÃÂ    Ways to Contact UsÃÂÃÂ    1.

Leita Teuton Timeline           Risks and challenges  Our vision for Leita Teuton has always been to produce a smartwatch with both classic styling and leading technology. There have been big challenges in bringing Leita Teuton to life and for nearly three years our team has been working long hours to refine and optimize the design, technology, production and logistics for Leita Teuton.  WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve worked diligently with our partners for many months to fine tune every aspect of the Leita Teuton and identify and eliminate any areas of weakness which may cause issues with performance, durability and user satisfaction. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve invested an enormous amount of time and our own finances on research, development, sourcing, prototyping and testing. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re in the final stages of this and we need your help to get over the last hump and make Leita Teuton a reality.  Secondly, we have very skillful and professional suppliers and do not anticipate delays to our shipping timeline. However, if by chance anything unexpected happens, we promise to keep you informed, both during the campaign and afterward.

I pitched for seven seasons of professional baseball with the Atlanta Braves Organization before giving it up to build TheCause. I graduated from the College of Charleston with a degree in Business and an eye for social entrepreneurship. For fun I love to play outside with my dog Parker, visit my family out West, mimic my girlfriend's British accent, golf, exercise, see live music, listen to podcasts, and read. And of course, root on my old teammates still playing ball.",1.0,2019-06-17 09:04:00 -0400,Backed 0 projects,"Charleston, SC",KO,"The Nutshell  TheCause is a mobile crowdfunding app designed to help users raise money and awareness for the charities and non-profits committed to changing the world. Users can run, walk, or bike miles that are tracked through the app or synced through a fitness device (e.g. Fitbit/AppleWatch).ÃÂÃÂ        Users gain  Sponsors  by sharing their campaigns through posts via social media.  Sponsors  who are moved to help can donate by simply clinking on the link in the post. They can choose to give a flat donation or sponsor the user by the mile, making the user responsible for earning their support. Posting updates weekly will keep your sponsors in the loop and attract new sponsors to your cause, increasing the value of each mile. As those miles add up, you start raising serious funds for your cause. As if waking up early for that morning jog isn't an accomplishment in itself, imagine seeing you've raised $50 for cancer research by running a few miles before work.ÃÂÃÂ   For example: Jenna just started her cause campaign to raise awareness and funding for mental health to benefit the National Alliance of Mental Health. Her first week she receives 5 sponsorships after posting to Facebook. Each sponsor is willing to give Jenna $1 per mile for 2 weeks. Jenna runs 3 miles every morning before work and averages 2 miles walking about during the course of the day. After the first week, Jenna has moved 35 miles and raised $175! Overcome with excitement she shares her progress and again asks for support through Instagram and receives another 5 sponsors willing to donate $2 a mile for 1 week. By the end of week 2, Jenna has raised $700 for her cause!ÃÂÃÂ        After downloading the app from the App Store, you create a profile or sign in with Facebook and choose your cause and the charity you wish to benefit. From there, users pick their goal amount or timeframe, and share their cause with their social media following. As soon as the first sponsor comes in, you can start running, walking, or cycling to earn those pledges!ÃÂÃÂ         Sponsors  also have options when pledging by the mile. They can either choose to donate by the $/mile and timeframe, 3 weeks for example, for the user to log as many miles as possible. Or, they can pledge a $/mile rate up to a certain amount, with no timeframe. This is to add financial protection to the sponsor avoiding surprise credit card statements after sponsoring an ultra-marathoner. ÃÂÃÂ   Once the campaign reaches their goal or the timeframe is done, the users will be able to extend the campaign or send their earned sponsorships to their chosen non-profit or charity.ÃÂÃÂ        Everyone has a cause. Is it your grandfather's Alzheimers? Your sister's Diabetes? Or maybe your cause is providing clean drinking water or access to education in Third World countries. If you don't think you have a cause, then enjoy your fantasy world but don't clog the sidewalk I run past you. The rest of us live in this world and my cause is cancer. My mom was diagnosed with Leukemia a year ago. ÃÂÃÂ I'm not a doctor or scientist so I can't cure it, but I'm far from hopeless, and she doesn't have to battle alone. TheCause is designed for people like you, people like me, people who aren't okay sitting by and waiting for change or miracles. But you know what? I am Change. If I can't cure cancer myself, I'm going to run my ass off to fund the people who will.  The Story  Less than a year ago I was signing autographs for kids who came to watch me play baseball. Everyone knows that the wand chooses the wizard, and for me, my magic came when I picked up a baseball. Fast forward twenty some years, and I was living out the dream I had my entire life: to play professional baseball. ÃÂÃÂ And at 28 years old, in the peak of my career, ÃÂÃÂ I gave it all up.  I received a call from my Dad one night after a game. ""Son, your Mom's cancer has reached her brain. You need to come home now."" ÃÂÃÂ Red-eye flight from Atlanta to San Francisco. I found my mother in a hospital room, tubes and machines connecting her to life. I'd never seen her look so small, so broken. I realized I had come home to say good bye.ÃÂÃÂ   I was brought up to believe that I was the master of my own fate and that anything was possible if you didn't give up. As I slept in a hospital chair next to her bed those nights, I was overcome with helplessness. The realization that the virtues that propelled me my whole life were were a lie, turned me into an angry, ungrateful, self-pitying mess. As friends and family sent their best wishes and words of encouragement, I couldn't help but feel hollow.  My Mom never ceases to amaze me. She stabilized. ÃÂÃÂ I was a fool to doubt her strength and inspired by her, I found my own. ÃÂÃÂ The doctor told us, somewhat more elegantly, that she's not about to die, but rather, slowly dying. Progress. Now there was time for me to do something, now there was time for me to save her. I spent days walking around the hospital trying to come up with a plan. Pacing and thinking.  Ok, I'm definitely not a doctor or a scientist.  Pacing. Thinking.  Holy shit. There are a lot of sick people in this place.  ÃÂÃÂ Thinking. Pacing.  Why is everyone sitting around waiting for the enevitable? Do something! ÃÂÃÂ  Pacing. Pacing.  Sorry. That was harsh, all I'm doing is turning oxygen into carbon dioxide and putting one foot in front of the oth--.   Light Bulb.  Once my Mom convinced me she was going to fight this thing, she told me to go back to my team and continue pursuing my dream. I listened to her. What she didn't know is that when I tendered my resignation from the Atlanta Braves, it was the beginning of a new dream.  Since then, I enrolled back in college and graduated with a degree in business, I built a prototype for this very platform, and a plan to make it happen. Recently, after a success bone marrow transplant, my mom has been declared in remission! She won her battle but the war isn't over. Disease, Hunger, Pollution, there are too many causes to name and not enough being done about them. I realized, through my own experience, that it's really hard to know what you can do. Of course we'd all like to writes thousand dollar checks and send them to charities, but for most of us it's not realistic. We can't all become doctors, researchers, freedom fighters, or full time activists. TheCause is built for people who want to do more but maybe don't know how. ÃÂÃÂ By putting one foot in front of the other we can raise money and awareness for the issues we want to help. Doing more allows us to be more.ÃÂÃÂ   The irony of using a crowdfunding platform to raise money for a crowdfunding platform is not lost on me. I wish I could run to earn your pledges. I would run as far as it took to reach this goal. Instead I hope to earn your pledges by trust. Trust that I will build something that will help the millions of people, like you and me, who want to impact the world. We can do this by funding the movements, the research, and organizations who do what we cannot. Their progress depends on our support and our hope for cures and change depends on them.  I am asking for your help to raise $10,000. With it, I can partner with a development team who will help build what's called an MVP or Minimum Viable Product. It is a basic, version 1.0 of TheCause App. It might not have the sophisticated GPS, or sync with all fitness devices, but will be functional with iPhones and Androids using your phones integrated pedometer to track steps and an algorithm to translate your steps to a fairly accurate mile tracker.ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  Facebook's Birthday Fundraisers raised almost half a billion dollars last year. While that is an enormous amount of money going to good causes it isn't enough. Imagine being able to raise funding year round. And instead of asking for support for turning a year older, you are actively earning it. I promise, there is nothing more fulfilling or inspiring than giving a piece of yourself to better the world. Give your sweat.  If this Kickstarter is even more successful and we can raise more than the $10k, I can integrate some very cool user features that will help you grow your Cause Campaigns. If you have features you'd like to see built in, please share them with me. I want to build the platform you want, not the one I think you want. With additional funding we can add features like:  -Team Campaigns, you and your group team up to raise money together. By utilizing the exponential reach reach of more team members you'll be able to earn more sponsors faster which equals huge donations! -GPS integration, to track your mileage even more accurately. -Fitness Device Compatibility, to track mileage and fitness goals more efficiently without having to have your phone on you. -Access to more charities/nonprofits, there are 75,000 charities and nonprofits in America alone. TheCause Charity database will start with the biggest but will eventually expand to your local organizations. Our challenge will be vetting these smaller charities to make sure they are properly accredited so you know your fundraising money will not be pocketed but used to make a difference. -In-App posting to all major social media outlets. Facebook will be included in Version 1.0 as users will be able to login with their facebook profile or an email address. In the near future, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and Youtube will be integrated as well. Until then you'll still be able to post a link to your Cause Page for you Sponsors to donate from, but the goal is to make your campaign reach as wide and seamless as possible. -TheCause Apparel, customized clothing for your Cause that your Team or Sponsors can purchase with a portion of that money going towards your fundraising goal. I've done charity walks before and it is so great to see a group wearing the colors and names of the people and cause they're honoring."

Our flagship product is the QMD (www.cue-md.com), a first of its kind training aid for billiards. Clean Gleem is another product we have under development and moving towards commercialization.",1.0,2019-05-17 09:28:41 -0400,Backed 0 projects,"Highland, Indianapolis, IN",KO,"Informed pool players know that clean pool balls are essential for accurate shots and consistent play. ÃÂÃÂ Smudged balls with finger prints, chalk residue and other dirt just don't react predictably. ÃÂÃÂ With dirty balls shots throw erratically, clusters don't break apart crisply and the dreaded skid is more prevalent. ÃÂÃÂ Regardless of how skilled you are or how much you practice, those tough shots aren't going to drop if you're unsure how the balls will react.  Clean Gleam is a patent pending billiard ball cleaning and polishing machine. ÃÂÃÂ It quickly, conveniently and thoroughly cleans your balls to make your shots more predictable and accurate. ÃÂÃÂ If you demand the highest standards in your equipment or are just a casual player, properly cleaned balls will make your games more enjoyable and in some cases more profitable.        What are the benefits?   If you've ever cleaned a set of pool balls by hand you know it's time consuming, not to mention forearm tiring. ÃÂÃÂ Easily neglected, hand cleaning is not something you look forward to and often the result is balls not as well cleaned as they should be. ÃÂÃÂ In commercial settings daily hand cleaning of multiple sets of balls just isn't practical but clean balls is something players appreciate and expect.   Clean Gleem quickly, conveniently and safely cleans an entire set of sixteen balls in minutes. ÃÂÃÂ Your balls will always have an attractive shine and the consistent play you and your opponents/patrons expect.    Clean Gleem is specially designed to minimize it's size and weight. ÃÂÃÂ With a footprint of about 12"" x 28"" it's an easy fit on a shelf or counter. ÃÂÃÂ Weighing in at about 45 pounds it's easily portable yet substantial.    With it's solid build and attractive natural wood finish Clean Gleem will complement the decor of your home room. ÃÂÃÂ You'll be proud to display it.    Using full ball bearing construction and a powerful, constant-duty 1/4 HP motor Clean Gleem will stand up to daily commercial use and a lifetime of home use. ÃÂÃÂ     Easily, economically replaceable polishing pads will keep the Clean Gleem working like new over the years.    Clean Gleem uses a totally unique, patent pending spiral roller technology that ensures a quick, complete cleaning of the entire surfaces of the balls and gives them that new ball gleam. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ          How to use Clean Gleem   Aramith Billiard Ball Cleaning solution is recommended for cleaning your balls with the Clean Gleem machine. ÃÂÃÂ Aramith is made specifically for cleaning phenolic balls and gives them a nice luster without a slick, oily feel. ÃÂÃÂ Other solutions, particularly automotive products, often contain silicon or waxes that, though real shiny, are excessively slick, play erratically and wear off during the course of a match leading to inconsistent play.ÃÂÃÂ   To clean your pool balls rub just a SMALL dab of cleaner onto the entire surface of each ball with a cloth. ÃÂÃÂ The Aramith cleaner quickly dries to a dull haze. ÃÂÃÂ Place the balls into the Clean Gleem machine and turn on the timer switch, a few minutes is all that's needed. ÃÂÃÂ If your balls don't need a complete cleaning you can quickly 'freshen them up' any time without using cleaning solution, it just takes a minute. ÃÂÃÂ Then remove your balls, wipe off any dust with a clean cloth and you're ready to play.ÃÂÃÂ   How it Works  Under the hood Clean Gleem works with a unique patent pending system of belt-driven, ribbed, spiral wound rollers. ÃÂÃÂ The rollers impart a spin and tumble to the balls so all surfaces contact the cleaning pads, resulting in a complete, quick cleaning. ÃÂÃÂ The cleaning pads are replaceable, just remove the worn pads and press in the new. ÃÂÃÂ The pads are 3/4"" Velcro loop self adhesive strips easily obtained at fabric stores or many on-line sources.       Other pool ball cleaning machines you may have seen are large, bulky and use a revolving platter design. ÃÂÃÂ Clean Gleem is unique with it's spiral roller design that allow it to be lighter and more compact while providing a fast, complete cleaning.

As with most small businesses funding is tight and market acceptance of a new product is uncertain. ÃÂÃÂ The Kickstarter platform, with its great community of innovators and early adopters, provides us with a way to address these problems.  Being able to introduce Clean Gleem to market will be possible with the help of Kickstarter supporters. ÃÂÃÂ It will allow us to...   Finalize development.    Source parts and arrange manufacturing in economically viable quantities so we can provide Clean Gleem to our users at an affordable price.    Obtain the visibility and acceptance of Clean Gleem in the pool playing community needed for further growth and refinement.         Where We Stand   We've hand crafted a small number of Clean Gleem machines and are very pleased with how well they work. ÃÂÃÂ We have discussions underway with cabinet shops and parts suppliers to arrange larger volume manufacturing. ÃÂÃÂ We are confident that we'll be able to deliver Clean Gleem machines to our backers in a timely manner.  As soon as we are successful in securing the necessary funding we plan to go into production and begin shipping units as they're completed.           Risks and challenges  We are close to finalizing the Clean Gleem design and have prototypes that work great.  Our largest remaining challenge lies in manufacturing - essentially obtaining parts and assembling.  Thus far we've identified and established relationships with various suppliers to obtain parts in small volumes.  The next step is manufacturing larger volumes in a timely manner to satisfy our pledge commitments.

The discussion about the future of the Cathedral is still in progress. Will it be rebuilt exactly the same as it was? Will it be changed? There is plenty of ideas, including futuristic ones, that assume to change construction completely. Despite our point of view on the future of the Cathedral, I think we can agree: the memory of the original shape of the Cathedral can't be lost. That is why we need a virtual model, that can be used to educate young generations or simply to admire the beauty of the original one.  The value brought by 3D modelÃÂÃÂ     Educational 	  ÃÂÃÂ    The model will serve as a base for virtual tours. All objects will be marked with comprehensive information in writing. We'll also create a virtual tour guide in many languages. The tour will be optimized for different age groups. Rich animations, professional lectors and interactivity will bring the new quality to the learning. Of course, the tour will be free to use worldwide and adapted for the VR headsets, PC and smartphones. Every school in the world will have an amazing opportunity to show the beauty of the Cathedral. ÃÂÃÂ     Cultural 	  ÃÂÃÂ    We will create a model which will last forever. The historical value will be preserved and accessible across the globe.    Accessibility 	  ÃÂÃÂ    The model for the visually impaired. As we have experience in creating 3D printed spatial orientation maps we would like to prepare the model adapted for visually impaired needs. The files will be free to use for everyone who has 3D printer and wants to print it. We also would like to give to the city of Paris the model to be used by visually impaired tourists.    Virtual reality stand ÃÂÃÂ    We want to open a mobile VR exposition that will allow people who don't own VR headsets to experience virtual reality for the first time!   Not only Notre Dame. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s just a start! leveraging gained experience and developed techniques allow to implement solutions to other places and objects of world cultural heritage.    HOW?   We believe that the people, when are united, can do amazing things. We believe in free and open education. We believe in the power of The Cloud. In one sentence: We believe in crowdfunded open source projects. ÃÂÃÂ   With modern technology, we use photos and movies as a source to create 3D shapes. Those can be used to prepare Virtual Reality. So we can create Virtual Notre Damme using your photos and it will be exactly as it was before the catastrophe! Using Cloud Computing power and cloud storage we will be able to calculate the hundreds of billions of the pixels. Those data, after processing, can be used to create complex 3D presentations, models for visually impaired and VR tours.    WHAT DO WE NEED?   The scale is power. We need, hundreds of thousands of photos or movie frames. Basically, we need every photo and movie that you took. Even a selfie from your smartphone! ÃÂÃÂ    Share your photos ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ  HOW WE WILL USE YOUR SUPPORT  ÃÂÃÂ   The goal is to raise 10.000 euros. This is an amount that covers only costs of collection, storing, software and computing power. What does it mean? If we have this goal achieved we can create a solid base for future work. It will be a 3D model published online with a detailed description. This model will be open for everyone and can be used in 10 or 50 years by everyone if there will be need. So basically the goal of the collection will be enough to preserve the original shape of the cathedral.  Every extra dollar above the sum will add a possibility to extend features and application of the 3D model. On the top of the solid base, we will develop virtual tours, adaptation for render engines and model for visually impaired.  As those ideas need hundreds of hours of work we won't be able to finish it without extra financing or volunteering. So if you want to help us with this project, go to the  volunteers ' page or sponsor our project.   The future of our past is in The Cloud.       Risks and challenges  The only real risk is that we won't collect enough materials for reconstruction. So tell your friends and share info on social media and it will never happen!"

It affixes to your carÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s dashboard/windshield with a suction cup or clamps on the air vent with a clip. The mount also features a hinge and a swivel ball that allows rotation and extension of your phone to a comfortable viewing angle in portrait or landscape mode. The cradle design holds and locks your phone securely in place even on bumpy rides while giving a power boost to your phone when using GPS, taking hands-free calls, and more.            Incarnated in the unique form of a cute yet stern owl, Awl adds chicness to your dashboard while reliably holding your phone for you for an easy access to audio controls, directions and messages, etc. while you are driving. It is blessed with a built-in infrared sensor in its tummy that opens the wings as you approach it and automatically embraces and locks your phone securely into place.       Its two feet give stable support to your phone on the bottom. To release, gently touch its feet and it will let go. One hand operation makes everything easier and safer for you road warriors.ÃÂÃÂ             Mallper offers wireless charges to compatible phones @ 5W, 7.5W, 10W and all the way up to 15W, which is 30% faster than other standard ones.ÃÂÃÂ        This will work if you have a Samsung Galaxy S9 Series, Huawei Mate 20 Pro and other Qi Fast Charge-enabled smartphones. It charges your phone without the hassles of wires and just a few minutes of charging will give you more battery life than most chargers. It keeps your phone staying charged while you are on the road all the time.            Mallper features an ultra silent and responsive servo motor that opens and retracts the wings in smooth and quiet motion with barely noticeable noise compared to other loud auto clamping car mounts. And once the phone is placed, the wings will close and stop when they reach the side of your phone and clutches it with the right amount of force that locks it in place without breaking it, regardless of what size it is or whether the case is on.ÃÂÃÂ             The owlÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s eyes light up in blue once the power is plugged in, providing a great feedback on that the device is up and ready and an indication on the location of the device in the darkness. ÃÂÃÂ When your phone is clipped in and charging, the eyes light out. The eyes blink on detection of any foreign object (keys, metal phone case, etc.) placed on it.            Mallper provides a strong clamped hold and suction while being mounted to the air vent, dashboard or the windshield, preventing your phone from being jiggly when you glance at it while you drive.            Mallper features a swivel ball that allows a 360ÃÂÃÂ° rotation that can easily set your phone in different viewing angles.ÃÂÃÂ        Landscape mode is ideal when using navigation apps, while portrait mode makes hands-free calls and listening to music much easier.            Mallper keeps your phone stable and wobble-free even with sharp turns on bumpy roads, giving your phone an uninterrupted charge.             Mallper uses a standard USB-C connection (adapter not included).ÃÂÃÂ        It has built-in safety protection from overcharging, overcurrent, short circuit and temperature control.       And intelligent circuit for real time optimization of wireless charging power.

Any 20 time/date-based automations at any time are included!  Need more? - upgrade to another reward level and never worry.  Higher reward levels save you more money.  And now the details:  Your Smart Home is actually pretty dumb. Let's fix that!       It's not you, it's the setup. The setup is just too complex.ÃÂÃÂ   Who has the time or inclination to fiddle with tons of different brands, settings, and scenarios? Even if you are a die-hard Smart Home enthusiast, do you really want to come home from work and start writing some more code just to have your light bulb automated? Okay, maybe the die-hards would; but even they need a break now and then.ÃÂÃÂ   Imagine this: your devices somehow started working together intelligently. Not just by the ""smart"" name on the box, but in reality. Wouldn't that be wonderful!   The ideal Smart Home controllerÃÂÃÂ        Such an ideal system would be quick and simple to set up with a wide range of connected devices while allowing much flexibility. It would have an easy setup wizard in case you needed something done in a jiffy. At the same time, it would allow granular control over every device, should you decide to unleash your inner tinkerer. And it would work absolutely everywhere (not just on rPi server... just saying...). Your home controller would securely work on every smartphone, PC, Mac, tablet, Kindle, anything connected to the Internet. From anywhere in the world. At any time of your choosing. Because nothing is more annoying than leaving for a vacation in Paris and suddenly remembering you didn't turn off that AC in your Arizona house.ÃÂÃÂ   Is this some utopian vision, or can it be achieved with this Kickstarter?   The good news:  It actually can happen, with your support!ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        We have designed the easiest-to-use system to help you set up your connected devices. Moreover, it is full-featured with rich functionality and compatibility with virtually every connected device. It is super affordable, too (plus: save even more money with this special Kickstarter-only double bonus offer!)  There's nothing to install or maintain. Smart Casa just works for you.  Make Your Casa Smart Again! (take this tongue-in-cheek reference as a jab or a homage, your call.)   This one is pretty smart, you know  smRt it is. See, we tried many names. For instance, ""your-smart-home-controller"" sounded technically correct but a bit tedious to type as a web address. So we settled on the name that is short and sweet. Nope, it ain't shawty. Let us introduce you to your intelligent home/garage/office controller:   SMRT.casa ÃÂÃÂ        See what we did there? Smart Casa. Sweet and intelligent. And boy, is it short and easy to type in your web browser. SMRT.casa has a well-designed web interface and it works in any browser.  Remember the specs of an  ideal system ? (flashback:  it should work absolutely everywhere. On every smartphone, PC, Mac, tablet, Kindle, anything connected with the Internet .)ÃÂÃÂ   Done!   What can SMRT.casa do for you  The usual stuff - plus some pretty awesome, exciting, unique stuff!       - easily monitor (is my AC still on?) and  intelligently control your home devices  (turn my lights on/off in a random pattern to ward off the bad guys while you are on vacation or just out of your home/office). Of course, besides intelligent automation, the simple  turn On/Off  operations are always available at a button click as well, from anywhere in the world.  - integrations via IFTTT  and  directly with some API-enabled devices  - set  automation with timers  (start charging my electric scooter at 14:30, then turn off after 2 hours) and logic (if a new client email is received, blink my office desk light twice). Did you know...  neither IFTTT nor Google Assistant has any timers ?  SMRT.casa fixes that  for you.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   - easily see and change any settings at any time;  -  parse emails  sent or forwarded to your unique SMRT.casa address. You set the keyword-based rules in the message's Subject and Body (endless possibilities here; think Zapier built-in at no additional cost);  - send out  email reminders on-schedule  (payment reminders to the clients; birthday greetings to your loved ones, etc. With the email-to-SMS gateway, this may also become SMS as well.)  - all this and more, from anywhere in the world with an Internet connection.  Secure account, private server, NO sharing of your personal information. In fact, only a bare minimum of your info is ever kept - just enough for servicing your account, and it is promptly encrypted... both on the way to our system and on our server.  Religious email support. The meaningful one, you know, not just bouncing you off and blaming you for everything like some others do.  We want you to be happy with SMRT.casa   Oh, and SMRT.casa works on anything - smartphones, tablets, desktops, Kindle, Mac, PC, iOS, Android, Linux... literally on anything with a web browser. There is nothing for you to install or maintain - just log in to your SMRT.casa and voila. Control or monitor your home, garage, office from anywhere in the world, any time.   Log in / Interface Demo as of now:        Why SMRT.casa is better  - It  does work when everything else fails . SMRT.casa keeps working even if your local Internet or your electricity (gasp!) is out. Email parse/send service, as well as all other online services in SMRT.casa will keep functioning as-scheduled. Your clients and important contacts will be notified as if nothing happened, and your cash flow / data flow will continue as normal.  - Unlimited,  secure access anytime, from anywhere . What if you are NOT on the smartphone where your app is installed? What if you are NOT next to your home automation hub's screen? Bummer. On contrast, SMRT.casa is accessible anytime, from any device with Internet access, anywhere in the world. No need to be glued to any particular gizmo.ÃÂÃÂ        -  Easy  to set up, easy to make changes. Feels like you have to be a nuclear scientist to set up your smart home? No more! SMRT.casa lets you set up everything very easily. Making changes, as well as monitoring your things, are equally easy and intelligent with SMRT.casa -  our interface is specifically designed for simplicity of operation .  - Clearly  see what is going  on at any particular time. SMRT.casa gives you both an overview and granular real-time monitoring of your devices' states and what they are programmed to do next.  - Available in  your language . Hi! Bonjour! Hallo!

(Coming up; English available by default right now.)  -  Unique features: email parsing  - SMRT.casa detects and acts upon any keywords you set up as triggers. Other services charge you an arm and a leg for the email parsing, but with SMRT.casa this feature is built-in!  -  Unique features: email reminders . Shoot out email notifications to your clients with meeting or payment reminders. Friends and family birthday greetings -  never forget the date  as SMRT.casa will send them out automatically on the schedule you have pre-set! Set them up easily, choose the frequency and the message, then pause/restart/delete as you please. ÃÂÃÂ There are other companies that only offer this one task - and charge you for it - while this is a built-in SMRT.casa feature! Awesome!  - And more.  We take care of the tech. You enjoy your smart life.   Fuck the cloud!       Yeah!!  ...um, well, I dunno. Let's talk about this one for a sec. Take something as familiar as email, for instance. An email? Aren't we talking about the smart home? Yup. Stay with me, you'll see the connection momentarily.  I don't know about you but neither of us here have an in-house  email server . All our email needs are covered by the cloud-based service providers. No-one is complaining or getting spooked by this fact - it is just a given. And boy, you should see some private stuff that gets sent by email.ÃÂÃÂ  So then, it's okay to rely on some cloud-based service for such an important thing as email.  And don't get me started on electricity, mobile communications, etc. etc. - none of them are managed as your private in-house system, either. Unless you are a country president or an Amish, that is.  Is this just a question of habit? Email is ubiquitous, therefore we never question why is it cloud-based. We don't feel threatened by the perceived lack of privacy, possible leaks, or an occasional interruption of service. We know from experience that all such events are exceedingly rare, so  we are not  really forced to build and maintain a private email server in-house to mitigate any of those factors. In fact, most would consider such proposition to be utterly ridiculous.  Then why are we so threatened by a cloud-based home control system? You know, it does have all the advantages of, say, a  cloud-based email  that we all successfully utilize for many years already.ÃÂÃÂ (I told you there was a connection, didn't I.)  Surely you can stay local with anything, including building and maintaining your own home automation server - but how local can it really be when the APIs of your devices still go through the servers in China?   Well-behaved cloud is good for you       ÃÂÃÂ We really think that since the Internet-based (cloud) services are good enough for regular folks and big businesses-alike to rely on in their everyday tasks, from email to online software suites, then they also should be perfectly fine in a smart home controller.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    Please support SMRT.casa  - it provides you with a fine service without the need to install or maintain anything locally! And that's a good thing. You have better ways to spend your time. Please watch the video to see how it works. Make a pledge.   All I heard was blah blah. I want my privacy!  And we are taking your privacy most seriously. We do care. After all,  we are already running our own homes and offices on SMRT.casa  as we speak, so we do have a vested interest in the privacy of this system!  Firstly: no private, identifiable information is kept by SMRT.casa, ever.ÃÂÃÂ        SMRT.casa has time-proven data protection techniques in place to protect your privacy.   No-one will know your real name . You can use any name you want, for example just your first name or an alias. This has no bearing on SMRT.casa functionality at all. And whatever you enter,  your name will be encrypted  in our records anyway. Both  your email and your account password are also encrypted  in SMRT.casa so if the database leak occurs (which is unlikely), all the data scrambled by our encryption will be totally unreadable. (BTW, your email is considered public information anyway... we are just making sure it does NOT become public by us.)ÃÂÃÂ    We will NOT know where you live.  Moreover, we will NOT know any of the locations where you are using SMART.casa. In fact,  you could not enter your address if you wanted to  since there's  no such field  in your SMRT.casa account.ÃÂÃÂ    We never know or record your full payment information ; just the date and amount go into your account for bookkeeping.ÃÂÃÂ   As you can see. we take great care of your privacy by not knowing who/where you are, and by encrypting the little we do know.

You probably already know the answer if you actually tried IFTTT (which we love, by the way!) In IFTTT, there are no timers; there's no email parsing or scheduled reminders; there's no way to make complex automation; and on. On contrast, SMRT.casa provides all that plus we are planning on making our own API bridges to the popular devices and services, making your smart home/business control and monitoring abilities even more flexible and more independent.   Is SMRT.casa easy to use?  SMRT.casa is designed to be easy and clear to anyone, even to the non-technical people. My mom uses it. 'Nuff said.        Release schedule:  - Running this crowdsourcing project and collecting funds: up to Sep 15  - Releasing the fully-working public version of SMRT.casa to you: Sep 30  Unlike other projects,  you get a very little wait with us !   Can we actually deliver?  Yes. A large range of projects very successfully delivered to a number of important clients in the last 25 years. We were trailblazing web design since the dawn of the Internet's mass appeal (the year 1995) and the first interactive Web 1.0 projects since 1999. Never stopped developing ever since. You can say we know what we are doing.ÃÂÃÂ   SMRT.casa is our favorite project, so rest assured you will enjoy the best of the contemporary functionality.  Besides, much of the work is already done - see the demo! Let's make the final push with your help now.   Why Kickstarter?       While the SMRT.casa system is already live and working fine for us and some other early adopters, we still need to put together the parts needed for the public release. Such as, polish the looks of the account creation page, the smart procedures, and other system blocks. Right now they do work in the ""hardwired"" mode. This Kickstarter will allow us to finalize their development with the nice-looking, convenient interface you will love to use.  Domain transfer from the provisional one (controlfu.com) to SMRT.casa - it takes some money and effort, too.  Paying off the partial costs of up-to-date development (we have already covered 90% of its cost ourselves out-of-pocket) and part of the domain names and server/DNS setup costs.   How much you can save:       With this special Kickstarter, your yearly cost can be  as low as just $1.60/month  ($19/yr) with  double the benefits  offered on our site. Think of it:  just for the email parsing part ,  other providers are charging $240/year  - that's TWELVE TIMES more, yikes! Compare that to what you are getting from SMRT.casa, and the choice is clear.  Suddenly,  your unruly Smart Home devices and services start playing nice  with each other and, most importantly, with you - once you support this SMRT.casa Kickstarter!  Use SMRT.casa for easy, yet intelligent setup and control of your Smart Home, Garage, and Office.   Choose your pledge now  to make this happen ASAP. Thanks! (check out this Kickstarter's special  double benefits , too!)      Risks and challenges  25 years of experience in the interactive web design, with many projects commercially delivered (not on Kickstarter.) There is some risk of certain devices/services changing their settings and not being available at all times. We will work on rectifying the issue if/when this happens. Overall, your risk is low. The prototype system is already in use by us and some early adopters, successfully."
320,project_000321,162946313,plastic-melter-prototipe,A plastic melting machine which uses friction to melt plastics.

Just 9% of it was recycled, 12% was incinerated and 79% was discarded in landfills or the natural environment.ÃÂÃÂ        The process of recycling reduced the consumption of water, reduced the generation of CO2 and also saved between 700-800kg of petrol/tons of plastic.     Purpose of the project    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ This project was created from a desire to increase recycling, including plastic products that are not recyclable (plastic film, bottle tops, plastic bags, etc ), and to provide a cleaner planet to our future generations.  "" Every year we buy around ÃÂÃÂ 3.7 million tonnes of plastic products in the UK. Much of this plastic ÃÂÃÂ is packaging, with only 842,000 tonnes being recycled.    Much ÃÂÃÂ of the plastic we use ends up in landfill. This is either because it is ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ currently not possible to recycle, individuals don't take it to be ÃÂÃÂ recycled or local authorities don't accept it ."" ( Source http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/z9tysg8 ÃÂÃÂ ""Why can't I recycle all plastics?"")   Let's give plastic another chance          ÃÂÃÂ Description of the projectÃÂÃÂ     ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Most of the companies use to melt plastic an external source or chemicals.The machine created by me will use friction.   How is possible?    ""When surfaces in contact move relative to each other, the friction between the two surfaces converts kinetic energy into thermal energy""   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ If you don't understand, just rub your palms for one minute.  The melting machine is composed of a fixed cylinder and a rotating core which rotates on with different speeds depending of the temperature.  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ The distance between the two parts at the top edge will be 20 mm and at the bottom and at the bottom will be 2 mm. The difference in the gap between the top and bottom will force the plastic to create friction which will generate heat.ÃÂÃÂ   In this process, the contaminating materials and different plastics that cannot be recycled will be reduced to small fragments and integrated into the melted plastic.    What is possible to do with this mixed plastic?   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ After the prototype will be completed ( with your help ), we will create samples of objects which the purity of the plastic will not be a requirement. For example, street cones, protection fences, feet for fences and much more.ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  The biggest challenge for the project is to be funded and if is not funded I will try to find other ways to get funds, because if we don't start to clean the planet now we'll get to a point where we are not going to be able to stop the climate change anymore. THIS IS THE ONLY HOME  WE HAVE."
321,project_000322,nt-smd-rgb,audio-spectrum-analyzer-with-in-9-tubes-called-nixielyzer,6-Band Audio Spectrum Analyzer with 6 x IN-9 NOS Nixie Bargraph tubes (Ready-to-Play or as an electronic DIY kit available),Technology,Saalfeld/saale | DE,False,3343.206930000001,1517.81594622,8.0,1563510327.0,1564077615.0,1566669615.0,False,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,"<!DOCTYPE html><html class=""users_profile_about fontface no-js"" data-request-id=""74d36ddb-9590-4efd-8b9c-f7a6b9524c8e"" lang=""en",7.0,2017-02-01 13:16:41 -0500,Backed 3 projects,"Berlin, Germany",25,"ÃÂÃÂ  ...the successful founded EM800 Magilyzer... ÃÂÃÂ   I was asked from many customers to build a similar kit but with an alternative display.  So Mr. Nixie has taken the EM800 Magilyzer and the former Nixielyzer kit, which is sold out, put them in a pot, added a heftyÃÂÃÂ dose of the legendary Mr. Nixie Magic, and finally a new kit, the  IN-9 Nixielyzer  was created.ÃÂÃÂ                    The  IN-9 Nixielyzer  is an analog audio spectrum analyzer, based around the BA3830S analog analyzer chip. It offers the display of six selective audio bands:  63 Hz, 150 Hz, 330 Hz, 1 kHz, 3.3 kHz and 10 kHz.  As an extra feature, you can mix the signal of a build-in microphone to the display, to use the IN-9 Nixielyzer as a stand-alone device when no wired audio source is connected.       The  IN-9 Nixielyzer  operates with six vintage NOS (New Old Stock) IN-9 Nixie Bargraph tubes and has two RCA stereo in- and outputs (for easy daisy chaining the device within an existing audio path) and also two 1/8"" TRS jacks for simple connecting your MP3 player, mobile phone plus headphone for listening etc.  Both signals (RCA and 1/8"" TRS) are only internal mixed via an electronic zero ohms node and do not affect each other.       The  IN-9 Nixielyzer  uses no digital signal processor or FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation); so the display is stepless and fully in realtime.  Furthermore a modified   dbx compandor   ciruity was introduced to enhance the displayed dynamic range.  The topology of the analoge electronics corresponds to that of the proven EM800 Magilyzer circuity.            You surely know a VU meter, which shows the level of an audio signal, on the DIY market often build with LEDs.     Self made LED spectrum analyzer found on Ebay    The  IN-9 Nixielyzer  now separates this audio signal into six selective bands and show their special audio level within this frequency range:   ÃÂÃÂ  63 Hz  = Low Bass (e.g. Bassdrum)    ÃÂÃÂ  150 Hz = Mid Bass (e.g. Bassguitar)    ÃÂÃÂ  330 Hz  = Low Mid (near concert pitch of the most musican instruments)    ÃÂÃÂ  1 kHz  = Mid of voice frequency (e.g. the ""beep"" sound for indecent words in interviews)    ÃÂÃÂ  3.3 kHz  = Presence (e.g. ""sch"" in the word  Schedule  or the imitated sound of a steam locomotive)    ÃÂÃÂ  10 kHz  = Heights (e.g. ""sssss"")   And as an absolute unique feature, the  IN-9 Nixielyzer  displays the level not on ""ordinary"" LED display or VFD display or on a computer screen or even in an App of your mobile phone but on  six IN-9 Nixie Bargraph tubes  made as surplus in the end of the 80's in USSR.        PCBs with double sided silk screen.    All necessary electronic components.    All necessary mounting hardware.    Complete enclosure with all necessary covers.    15 VDC wall mart power supply with EU mains or 12 VDC with adaptors for EU/US/UK/AU is included.    On request 6 x IN-9 tubes.

Very less generated heat.    Stereo RCA in- and outputs, connected in parallel, for easy daisy chaining in an existing audio path.    Two 1/8 TRS inputs, also connected in parallel, as an alternative for MP3 player, mobile phone, headphone etc.    The signal of both output paths (RCA and 1/8 TRS) do not affect each other.    Selectable audio channel for display (right / both / left).    Build-in microphone signal can be mixed for display.    63 Hz, 150 Hz, 330 Hz, 1 kHz, 3.3 kHz and 10 kHz audio spectrum level are displayed.    Build-in modified dbx compandor circuity for extended display dynamic range.    Variable blanking time and hight voltage adjustment for minimizing the issues specially with Argon filled tubes.

Dimensions (W x D x H): 135 x 95 x 160 mm incl. tubes      The assembled main PCB                   The word ""Nixie"" was formed from the words  N umeric  I ndicator e X erimental No.  1  ÃÂÃÂ and first introduced 1954 by Burroughs Corporation from USA as a brand name for numeric displays. Nixie tubes were used until the mid of the 1970's as displays in measuring devices, calculators, TV sets and the very first computers. The evolution of modern style display types like Numitron, VFD, Light Emitting Diodes and Liquid Crystal Displays, which have a very low supply voltage (battery power supply) eliminated these Nixie tubes from the market, and they are not produced anymore. In the former USSR Nixie tubes were produced as surplus in vast quantities until the beginning of the 90's ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> and from this sources are these tubes. ÃÂÃÂ But even these supplies are now running short. And when they're gone, they're gone. The tubes are taken from ""NOS"", what means  N ew  O ld  S tock. They were never used before and spent their first thirty or more yearsÃÂÃÂ forgotten in some Russian warehouse. The principle of the Nixie tubes is based on a cold cathode discharge and it is used today a million timesÃÂÃÂ e.g. in small neon bulbs of illuminated mains power switches. ÃÂÃÂ   The IN-9 Bargraph tubes in the IN-9 Nixielyzer are a specialÃÂÃÂ construction of such a neon bulb, it can produce a current depending variable glow hight lenght when a current regulated voltage of around 140 V is applied, and it was used in the USSR for example as a simple device to monitor the mains voltage range.      A vintage Russian mains voltage meter with IN-9 tube, found on Ebay     Often I was asked: ""What is the lifespan of a Nixie tube"" and than there is a simple answer: ""Have a look at your illuminated power switch of the multiple outlet strip. How many years does this small neon bulb lights continously without any aging issues?""

Many customers have asked me to create a new and cheaper device. The very first prototype PCB are arrived, so that I could build some working prototypes and take photos / videos. Thanks God ;-) there were no bigger issues as the electronics and the circuity are proven by the EM800 magilyzer and the former sold out Nixielyzer. However, as now the prototypes are finished and working reliable, the PCBs / electrical / mechanical parts needs to be ordered for a bigger batch of devices to get an affordable price.

It is a full-sized, precision cut sticker for your MacBook Pro which is identical to the original colour of the lid (Silver, Space Grey etc.). The reason this exists is two-fold:   Protection for your pride &amp; joy - This vinyl sticker is built to last thanks to 3M, originally meant for wrapping cars so you know it is tough and durable.    The opportunity to preserve and archive your wonderful stickers that we in the tech business seem to love.   Our laptops travel with us just about everywhere, meaning day after day they are slid in and out of busy rucksacks or bags and run the risk of scratching our pride &amp; joy. There are many opportunities for blemishes to occur to the lid, such as rubbing against something tough or abrasive whilst tightly packed into a carry-on bag for a conference, or you're simply in a rush and pick up your laptop whilst your car keys are in your hard etc.  With this sleek protective vinyl, all of those blemishes are on the vinyl rather than your laptop, helping to preserve it whilst still showing off its unique attributes to the world.  Here I have framed my prototype, showing just how closely the colour matches the Apple Silver, as well as just how great it looks once taken off and framed...       That's great, but why?  I produced a whole blog post as to why and how, which gained a lot more interest than I was expecting. In short, I wanted to put stickers on my laptop but had a couple of reservations at to why:   ÃÂÃÂ  Resale  - Selling the laptop meant I lost the unique stickers I have gained over time from conferences and meetups. Peeling each of them off would ruin them.    ÃÂÃÂ  Damage  - When removing the stickers, each would leave a residue behind and a slight discolouration where some of the aluminium has been covered up and other parts exposed to the sun.    The Idea  I began thinking of ways to combat these issues. I came up with a small list of requirements that would satisfy my needs:   Fairly invisible, without close inspection of the laptop    Easily removable    Leave zero trace even after months or years of application     Bonus Feature:  Something that can be kept, so that those sentimental stickers arenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t lost.    The Prototype  Having tried a few different sticker type materials, I eventually found vehicle wrap vinyl worked best for the prototype. The idea of clear/transparent sticker was an option, but the risk of it becoming discoloured &amp; not looking great upon removal meant these were discounted. The other drawback to clear vinyl is that once removed and placed within a frame on a backing card, you lose the silhouette of the lid including the logo etc.  I began hunting &amp; ordering as many samples as I could from ÃÂÃÂ various suppliers, where the colour appeared to very closely resemble ÃÂÃÂ that of the MacBook Pro aluminium Silver.  I donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t have a Space Grey device to test against, but I did see some samples which may certainly do the job for these too. This is something that will be a priority if this Kickstarter is funded.   Below are all of the samples applied together, to get an idea of which provides the best match.       As the vinyl wrap material intended for vehicles, it comes with some additional properties which are really useful:   Purposely wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t leave any residue behind (and if they do, easy to remove)    Hard wearing, as they are used to battling the elements.    Super easy to apply, thanks to tiny ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0098>channelsÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> carved into the adhesive side, making air bubbles non-existent.    Once applied, you can barely tell the difference:            And so the idea was born, and my MacBook Pro stayed like this for over 6 months to test durability and to see how everything looked once it had been removed.       Everything worked perfectly, which is where I would like your help.   Quality &amp; Price  The vinyl being used here is extremely high quality and is absolutely built to last. Here are some of the specifications from 3M themselves:   Automotive Grade Vinyl    Durability - 5-6 Years    Service Temperature - -60ÃÂÃÂ°C to +107ÃÂÃÂ°CÃÂÃÂ     ComplyÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ feature allows trapped air to escape through micro air channels in the adhesive    ControltacÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ feature keeps the adhesive film repositionable on the application surface up to the final pressure at application    0.11mm Thick   I believe the price reflects the quality and precision of the product, preserving the original quality of your laptop whilst protecting it from scratches and scrapes during the time that you own it. It also provides you the opportunity to personalise your laptop without the worry of damage to the lid and allow you to preserve them as a little piece of history after the hardware as moved on.   What next?  With the prototype completed successfully, and the subsequent blog post getting  over 80,000  hits, and counting! I need your support to get this into production.  Initially, I planned to start really small and utilise hobbyist die cutters like the Silhouette or Cricut, but it quickly became apparent that they just aren't accurate enough for my liking and weren't up to cut (pun fully intended).   With this Kickstarter reaching it's goal, it will allow me to purchase a high quality vinyl cutter, equipment and supplies to be able to accurately produce these &amp; ship them all over the world.    Time has already been spent looking into logistics and costs, to ensure this is all feasible.    Currently I have a perfect vinyl match for Silver, and I will be working with a supplier to correctly identify a perfect match for Space Grey too. In fact I will be purchasing a spare MacBook Pro Space Grey case to take with me to ensure the best possible match.    I will also be looking to create LidLayers for Dell XPS machines too, as well as Lenovo Thinkpads which are both common among our lovely community.     Bulk Orders   I have had a few people ask about bulk orders for various IT departments - if you are genuinely interested, please reach out so that I can gauge interest and get an idea of numbers...   You can find the original details of this prototype and some of my musing at  grh.am.       Risks and challenges  There are a handful of risks associated with this - I only have a 2015 13"" MacBook Pro at my disposal, which is only 1 of the 4 machines that I intent to initially cater for. To compensate for that, I will be seeking 'beta testers' for the other machines once I have been able to produce a LidLayer for them to ensure they are accurate, before shipping them out.  I have purposely set quite pessimistic delivery dates for all of the rewards, to compensate for any possible delays in sourcing of equipment or supplies (including discovering a match for Space Grey)."

The camera you see in the photos above and in the images are actual working prototypes we have developed since then. The $300,000 we raise from this kickstarter will go directly to starting mass manufacturing for the Alulu Camera. Our device is complex, requiring many custom manufacturing lines which is why we need to raise such a large amount. We expect to start shipping cameras in December 2020!   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ÃÂÃÂ   The Team       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Risks and challenges  We understand and acknowledge that no project comes without risks and challenges. Despite our planning, there are circumstances that may be out of our control. If we meet with these events, we promise to communicate with full transparency to you, our backers, and work to resolve all issues in a timely manner.  We have made a backup plan B AND plan C in the unlikely case we reach a circumstance that prevents us from manufacturing the Alulu Receipt Camera.   Plan B: In the case that we are unable to meet our goal of manufacturing our first batch of cameras, those that were promised a camera will be entered in a raffle for a handmade and assembled receipt camera made by our team members ourselves. The cameras seen in the photos and in the video are handmade and hand-assembled  by our team.  Plan C: If handmade cameras are no longer possible, those promised a camera will receive a clearly written DIY set of instructions to build their own simplified version of the Receipt Camera! The instructions will become open source.  Thank you for supporting the creation of Alulu Receipt Camera. We are eternally grateful for you!"

I do not think there is someone who has not been disturbed by the smells that emanate during the use of the toilet, or not to be embarrassed when someone used the toilet immediately after him. How many times did it happened to you ÃÂÃÂ in any hotel, even with many stars, after using the toilet, to have to wait a long time for the complete ventilation of the bathroom? Now the  TVS  removes all of these bothering issues. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ     Please support the achievement of this project so together we can make toilets more welcoming, without smells and make the world happier.    ÃÂÃÂ The current systems make ventilation of the toilets with the fans mounted in the ceiling of the room, having the disadvantage that the smells in the first phase are scattered into the room and then being evacuated outside.  ÃÂÃÂ To systems that aspire smells through the toilet flush pipe, when the water is drawn the aspiration of smells is interrupted and the smells spread in the bathroom.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   The  TVS  aspire odors directly from the toilet bowl, preventing their spread ÃÂÃÂ into the room and evacuating them to the sewerage network, as follows:  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ  - when a person sits on the toilet (considering that the toilet surface is occupied mostly by the person) a proximity sensor commands the opening of the air flap and starts the fan at low power (at some versions it is adjustable), sufficient to prevent the smells from spreading into the room. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ - when the person stands up, the proximity sensor keeps the air flap open and switches the fan to full power, because after the lifting of the person is released the entire surface of the toilet and it is necessary to suck up a larger volume of air, to prevent the smells from coming out in the room.

Standing on the toilet, I was stressed because the smells were spreading in the bathroom, knowing that another person was waiting to get in the bathroom after me.  We initially prepared the documentation for patenting. I have had other projects in work, just with a year ago we made the first prototype in a simplified form.  At first I underestimated the necessary budget, as well as the time required to start serial production.  We have made several variants, which we have been testing for many months. The molds for injection of plastic components are expensive and last a long time (some had to be adjusted later), I still have to make the molds for the gasket (the gasket is made of white silicone), and for the air flap. ÃÂÃÂ Electronic control modules for prototypes , were made manually. By the end of ÃÂÃÂ July, the modules will be made by a specialized company, with automated machinery.  At the same time, I study replacing the proximity sensor with a smaller one (any suggestion is welcome). I estimate that at the beginning of November 2019 I can start deliveries.

All three variants have been tested in the past 6 months and there were no operating problems. The molds for injection of plastic components are executed and awaits the command for serial production, with the exception of the molds for the air flap and gasket. For these, the drawings are sent to the manufacturer and given that they are small and simple components, their execution may not take more than 30 to 40 days. The company that makes the electronic modules has made the PCB template, has done the tests and by the end of July will be ready for serial production. Although the proximity sensors used work very well, we are looking for a smaller gauge sensor to improve the design. The electrical subassemblies used are CE certified. All the providers we collaborate with are very large companies,  which have very large production capacities. There is no risk that these products can not be produced. With regard to delivery, we have the chance to start delivering even faster. Delays may occur at shipping companies."

This is all made possible due to our in-house research and development of the  Solid-State Ion Fermentation Technique  that our team created.ÃÂÃÂ   With this technique,  we were able to reduce the particle size to make it smaller than the average skin pore.  This means that the anti-aging nutrients contained within black rice bran will be able to penetrate into the deepest layers of your skin!                                 Even though black rice bran has many outstanding benefits for our skin, it is difficult to extract all the nutrients from each grain because of its solid structure.ÃÂÃÂ However, our in-house developed solid-state ion fermentation Technology uses acidic ionized water to extract all the key nutrients from the hard outer layers of each grain.ÃÂÃÂ This process makes LuBi ampoule available to provide customers wide range of skin effects such as antioxidation, wrinkle improvement, brightening and moisturizing.                  Our in-house technology extracts only the best skincare components from black rice bran. LuBi ampouleÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s antioxidant(anti-aging) and wrinkle improvement components that are rich in black rice help restore firm facial skin. In addition, black riceÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s brightening and moisturizing features help improve uneven skin tone and help the skin stay moisturized for longer.                The apple that turned brown in the apple test above represents aged skin. Made of black rice extracts that are rich in antioxidant(anti-aging) ingredients, LuBi ampoule was able to restore the brown apple back to its original fresh color. This anti-aging property in LuBi ampoule can help prevent skin aging and give your skin a more youthful glow.        Your skin tone becomes uneven and darker as it ages due to the melanin production(pigmentation). This process is similar to the discoloration that occurs with apples that are exposed to oxygen for a prolonged period. As you can see on the image, once LuBi ampoule is applied on the apple slice, the area that was originally discolored is restored to its original form. The brightening effects will help improve your skin tone as well.          Moisturizing components (ceramides) are rich in black rice which helps the skin maintain its moisture, and keeps your skin from becoming dry.                                     Even though black rice bran has many outstanding benefits for our skin, it is difficult to extract all the nutrients from each grain because of its solid structure. However, our in-house developed solid-state ion fermentation Technology uses acidic ionized water to extract all the key nutrients from the hard outer layers of each grain. This process also makes LuBi ampoule's molecular size smaller than an average facial skin pore so that the nutrients can be delivered to the deepest skin layers.                     LuBi ampoule goes all the way into the deeper skin layers with its small molecular size. Other skincare productsÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> molecules do not get absorbed completely and therefore, the remaining residue on the surface of the skin can cause blockage in your pores and result in skin troubles.        When we dropped water and LuBi ampoule on each flower petal, the petal with LuBi ampoule was absorbed faster than the petal with water. Like the test above, LuBi ampoule absorbs rapidly into your skin and helps your skin maintain its moisture without any sticky residue leftover.ÃÂÃÂ             LuBi  Also  Works Great For  Men !

In-built with WIFI function. When the camera is connected to cellphone via APP, the images and videos will be synchronized to cellphone and they can be downloaded or shared to social network.       When it comes to the cameraÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s platform, you can choose the tracking, locked, following or crazy dog mode. The crazy dog is especially suitable for extreme sports, since the platform keeps up with a rising speed and lets the camera respond to every nuanced movement. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s right: you will never again worry about losing any shot when youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re taking pictures in a fast speed.                  At Botcam, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve developed the Stacam as a smart photography action camera that aims to explore a more intelligent, stable and better defined way for shooting. Our vision for the future doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t end here, though. We are focused on developing even more intelligent and more automatic shooting modes for the Stacam and for other products that we are researching. In 5 years, it is our goal to have a robot camera and an auto-shooting camera platform that can be used in any type of scenario. With your support, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll start by releasing the Stacam, with its truly remarkable features, and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be encouraged to go on creating an even more intelligent photographic future.                                 Risks and challenges  Like all Kickstarter projects, we will face certain risks and challenges in delivering this product at the quality we demand of ourselves. However, the Stacam team brings with it not only our passion but experience in engineering and manufacturing at scale, and we've made every effort to mitigate these risks for our backers.  With the support of our manufacturing and distribution partners, we are well prepared for the challenges ahead. We promise to be transparent and to keep our backers updated and informed about any issues that may come up and our solutions to such."

We have several patents on our mirrors and use proprietary SOGEL to manufacture Suma Mirrors to enhance your driving performance.  Currently, only overlay style is available, which uses adhesive to stick our mirrors on top of the OEM mirrors.ÃÂÃÂ   To improve, people have requested to have the OEM replacement style. Instead of putting on top of the OEM mirrors, the OEM replacement style allows our mirrors to directly replace the OEM mirrors.ÃÂÃÂ   In order to make this improvement, we need to invest and develop a metal mold to make the backplate, placed on the back of our mirrors, that will directly replace the OEM mirrors. Making this metal mold is very expensive, and we cannot do it without your support.ÃÂÃÂ   With your support, we can introduce Suma Mirrors for the Accord 8th Gen Community. To make it happen, we need to raise $12,000 dollars, about 60-80 pre-orders. If we achieve this goal, then we can bring Suma Mirrors to the Accord 8th Gen Community. Wouldn't you make it happen!?  Rewards (pre-orders)  There are 4 rewards (pre-orders) you can select to support the campaign.ÃÂÃÂ    1 .  Basic : a set of two mirrors with the following features  + Wide angle convex ÃÂÃÂ   + Blue Tint ÃÂÃÂ   + Hydrophobic (water repellent)   2. Basic + Defroster : a set of two mirrors with the following features  + Wide angle convex ÃÂÃÂ   + Blue Tint ÃÂÃÂ   + Hydrophobic (water repellent)  + Defroster   3. Basic + Defroster + Turn Signal : a set of two mirrors with the following features  + Wide angle convex ÃÂÃÂ   + Blue Tint ÃÂÃÂ   + Hydrophobic (water repellent)  + Defroster  + Turn signal   4. Rearview Mirror  (overlay adhesive)  + Wide angle convex  + Blue tint  Timeline  Campaign: 20 days  Design and Manufacturing: 2 months  Shipping: 1 week  Features   1. Wide Angle Convex   To enhance your safety and driving performance, Suma Mirrors use premium optic glass that creates the best wide angle convex to effectively reduce blind spot.  Our mirrors are R1000, whereas other mirrors are R1400. (The smaller the R-number, the wider the view).  If you compare Suma Mirrors with other mirrors, our mirrors have wider visibility and can see more objects in Suma Performance mirrors.   2. Hydrophobic (water repellent)   They are HYDROPHOBIC:  It is a fancy word for water repellent. This provides clear visibility in rainy conditions to provide safety and driving performance.  Our water repellent feature is permanent. This feature is coated during our proprietary SOGEL manufacturing process. ÃÂÃÂ Unlike Suma Mirrors, other mirrors typically use spray-on that the water repellent feature eventually erodes. Suma Mirrors are hydrophobic and permanent.ÃÂÃÂ    3. Anti-Glare   Suma Mirrors go through  proprietary  SOGEL process that takes multiple steps/days to produce our signature, blue mirrors such that the mirrors themselves are actually clear and colorless.  The reason Suma Mirrors look blue is because it absorbs all spectrum of the colors except the blue color that's pleasant to the eyes, ÃÂÃÂ effectively reducing glare (the yellow color spectrum, which causes the glare, is absorbed).  Other mirrors, in contrast, use the vacuum coating process such that the blue color is actually coated on the mirror itself (unlike ours, clear/colorless mirrors that only reflect blue color). Based on that, they are not truly anti-glare because the glare is still reflected to human eyes. Over time, the blue coating will eventually fade. Suma Mirrors do no fade and are truly anti-glare.  Video Review  This shows you what our mirrors look like on a different car.ÃÂÃÂ                       Risks and challenges  No risks. If we don't reach the goal,  you are not charged. You are only charged when we reach the goal."

ÃÂÃÂ Our frustration brought on by unsightly consumer electronics led us to the design of the QUBE. ÃÂÃÂ        We envisioned an interior design object, and went one step beyond.  We created a product that can charge your tech and be beautiful at the same time. The best of both worlds. Not only can you save your battery and stay clutter-free, you can also save space. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve designed it to be able to charge anywhere within your home, for your smartphone, air pods and even a smart watch.ÃÂÃÂ    That is true design!

Making it possible to simultaneously charge your device on top as well as the powerbank itself.                 The idea to integrate technology into interior objects originates from 2010. The company and brand MANU eventually was founded in 2016.                 Remember the magic of playing with wooden blocks as a child? A cube has an amazing form factor with symmetry depicted from whichever direction you look at it. ÃÂÃÂ You can build amazing structures with a cube and is therefore the base of any foundation.       Most ideas start with a problem. But once we managed to turn that insight into a proposition the sketching started.ÃÂÃÂ        Once we figured out the formfactor of what later became QUBE we started making a lot of basic mock ups. Shaping these from foam block was easier than 3d printing.       In the final phase of the design we upgraded the prototypes to 3d prints. The first came out of our own printer. Later we also outsourced the printing to a more refined model maker.            We now have finished the whole design, engineering phase and finished tooling. We are expecting First out of Tool samples end of July 2019.ÃÂÃÂ   UPDATE August 2019: We received first out of tool samples of all parts. It is amazing to see the QUBE built from actual manufactured parts instead of 3d prototyped parts. Next phase will be adding texture to tooling and getting the right blue color.

ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢ Veterans struggle to find a community when working towards attaining higher education.  ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢ Research shows that not having community results in a longer time to completion and less connection to others.  ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢ Low completion rates translate to fewer employment opportunities.               Our Solution   Using the power of technology we will partner to bring students together through our platform, TeamEDU Connect.  Focusing exclusively on education and not a broad focus of any ""meetup,"" obtaining support from libraries, corporations, and other partners will increase our ability to create a team focused learning environment.   We have a prototype of the App that can be viewed here. ÃÂÃÂ It is a seamless user experience!          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Average tuition at for-profit colleges is $16,000 per year.  Only 1.8 million will finish leaving 3.4 million without a degree representing a loss of opportunity worth $54 billion for those who do not complete.   Key Customers   The primary target audience for TeamEDU is institutional education providers with large Veteran populations attending. The secondary audience is current or upcoming students. Also, the platform will be open to anyone who wants to create a team and learn a new skill. The primary target market size is over 28,000 institutions with the secondary market of 141,686,000 people. We base this on 2017 U.S. Census data for educational attainment. Target groups include; High School Graduates (71,170,000) | Some College, No Degree (46,445,000) | Associate Degree, Occupational (10,081,000) | Associate Degree, Academic (13,990,000).

ÃÂÃÂ          Learning shouldn't be done alone, and you should have a place to collaborate, share ideas, and support each other that is not the clogged up, conventional outlets like Facebook. ÃÂÃÂ   TeamEDU is a place to learn, not a place for ad's. ÃÂÃÂ We will not put ad's on our site, in the app or otherwise. ÃÂÃÂ We want people to learn, not be distracted. ÃÂÃÂ          Together we will make a difference, by building a community focused on learning and education. ÃÂÃÂ          TeamEDU is dedicated to giving back to our community. ÃÂÃÂ A significant portion of all proceeds generated once the app launches will be offered out in the form of grants and scholarships.  TeamEDU believes it is vital to be supportive to our community and will strive to give as much in support of the future!            TeamEDU will be part of a new industry in the making! ÃÂÃÂ Education Services Technology (EdTech).           Risks and challenges  Challenges |  Barriers to Entry  We have the first-mover advantage in this niche market focused on Veterans. Other platforms have some similarities but do not focus on the unique needs associated with Veterans. We are emerging as a new industry in a crowded tech startup field, and the service offering is easily adaptable to other markets, especially those located in rural communities.  Recognizing, therefore, we will make philanthropic investments a pivotal attraction to how we conduct business and gain market traction.

Risks &amp; Mitigation  We need to succeed in educating the market on the benefits of community, the risks of going at it alone, and the positive impact of being connected to other likeminded Veterans. Since our business is a new take, with mentoring and community components being the key driver to how we differentiate, prospective customers may not immediately understand the full positive benefits of our offering. All our marketing activity will be angled to this end.  Another is overshadowing our second risk, a larger technology company, however, our differentiator from other platforms is their lack of a mentoring and community component. Meetup and Eventbrite are flourishing in U.S. metropolitan markets, and a successful player there could move down market to focus on smaller universities and institutions. It is essential that we take advantage of our first-mover advantage to make a strong name for ourselves.  Another risk is continual advances in technology that could take away our current advantage. We plan to keep close tabs on emerging trends in technology to ensure that we continue our platform on the forefront, taking advantage of new capabilities.  Finally, there is a small chance that poor reviews out of the gate could damage our adoption in its earliest days. Here, we plan to apply our best effort to ""wow"" customers with our exceptional, world-class service, so that we make sure we start ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094> and remain ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094> on the right foot."

The app offers several features to members, including a support community, a secure incident documentation and reporting system, and access to free mental health and legal resources. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        The #MeToo movement is a massive social campaign against sexual assault and harassment that highlights traumatic events experienced both women and men every day. High profile cases showcased the scrutiny that survivors face for sharing their stories and a need for more support avenues for victims of assault.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ             At Blawzy, our goal is to provide a digital safe space and actionable resources for anyone who has experienced traumatic events or wants to support survivors of sexual assault, violence, or traumatic events.ÃÂÃÂ        With all of the high-profile cases of sexual assault in the national media today, we believe itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s time to bring to market an app that makes a big difference. We want to give people a safe environment to get as many perspectives as they need in a safe and secure way, but also give them the tools to take next steps once theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve found the right path.ÃÂÃÂ        Blawzy was created as an answer to that need, offering a safe space for women and men who have faced sexual violence. Members can anonymously share their stories and discuss experiences, self-care techniques, and motivating content in the appÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s forum.ÃÂÃÂ   There are many reasons why a victim of sexual assault may choose to not immediately report an event to the police. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Whether itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s an issue of safety or just needing time to emotionally prepare for legal proceedings, many victims may wait months or years. Blawzy is aiming to provide a safe platform for women and men to document incidents of sexual harassment and assault, even when they are not ready to report.ÃÂÃÂ              Blawzy Serves 3 Primary Functions: ÃÂÃÂ    1. Documenting a traumatic eventÃÂÃÂ     2. Providing a support communityÃÂÃÂ     3. Connecting survivors with legal and mental health experts for free        Several features exist on the platform to protect survivors who are hoping to document their experiences. Saved reports will be dated and time-stamped and saved in an encrypted format to prevent user data from being put into the wrong hands. Users can easily gain access to their document if they choose to file a report and wish to use a dated statement as a reference.ÃÂÃÂ        Blawzy also offers resources for emotional support, including an anonymous online community to discuss coping techniques, share stories, or post motivating content. Users will also have access to free legal and mental health consultations and resources to help them find the experts theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re seeking.ÃÂÃÂ        Whether you are a professional, supporter, or have experienced traumatic events in your own life, Blawzy is worth a download. The app is an amazing collection of resources and community that is meant to help people through tough times.ÃÂÃÂ        The app will be available for download on both Android and iOS. The website and app offer a reporting feature that allows members to document events and archive them. We have cloud technology that will backup all files so you never lose the details of your personal story.ÃÂÃÂ        Each document and event entered into the Blawzy app will be time stamped and dated for reference. This gives our users the option to keep a private record of the incident if they are not yet ready to file an official report.ÃÂÃÂ   Blawzy will also provide resources to connect users to legal counsel and mental health experts with free consultations available. The app also provides resources for other mental health struggles, including anxiety, depression, and bullying.ÃÂÃÂ                        What Is Included In My Investment?ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂ¢<U+0097>ÃÂ Early access to the beta app and websiteÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0097>ÃÂ MugÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0097>ÃÂ Personal Thank Yous From The TeamÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0097>ÃÂ Ability To Write Support Letters To SurvivorsÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0097>ÃÂ Personalized Thank You Letters From SurvivorsÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0097>ÃÂ Status logos next to your name in appÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0097>ÃÂ Early Invite Access To Facebook Community and Support GroupÃÂÃÂ        We have taken a sensitive and unorganized system of processes and put them into one, easy to use digital space. Although there have been traditional resources for decades, no one has created a large scale digital app specifically to support survivors that helps connect professionals to those in need.ÃÂÃÂ        It does not matter if you do not have money to pay for a lawyer or therapy sessions. We have you covered. We find the professionals that care and connect you with them to access your personal situation and then gain access to their free consultations and other services.ÃÂÃÂ        We know traumatic events do not end. We help you heal over time with our community of survivors, supporters, and professionals so you can feel safe.            Blawzy is a high tech app that is meant to be tailored to any type of traumatic event, sexual assault, or act of violence. We offer resources that were previously scattered or unavailable to the average person. The interface was built to be easy to use and record your story quickly for personal record. You can tailor the app to your specific needs. We have both filters and real people who will be red flagging anyone trying to abuse the support system and community.ÃÂÃÂ          ***Blawzy is not affiliated with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, though we were inspired by her story.***ÃÂÃÂ      Product Specific FAQs:ÃÂÃÂ     Q: Is it really anonymous?ÃÂÃÂ     A : Blawzy is completely anonymous and allows users to access these resources without revealing their identities.ÃÂÃÂ    Q: What if I donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t want to be anonymous and I want to share personal details of my story to help others?ÃÂÃÂ     A : You can share personal details of your story, as long as you donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t mention the identity of any other individual.   Q: Do I create a user profile with my real name especially if IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m a certified professional?ÃÂÃÂ     A : You do use your real name, but your name with not be visible to other users or anyone else on the app.ÃÂÃÂ    Q: How do you prevent trolls from participating the app especially with anonymity?ÃÂÃÂ     A : We will rely on the community to report abusive users, who will then be banned.       If you have been touched by BlawzyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s mission but canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t financially back us at this time, please take the time to share with your network on your social media pages. It would really help us out. You can reach more people than you think. If you know anyone that would benefit from using Blawzy, please let them know. Our official hashtag is #Blawzy.            Risks and challenges  We have experience in producing consumer products. We are aware of some of the manufacturing challenges. Good design takes time and experience. We only expect small manufacturing delays if any. ThereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s always a chance of delays through customs or shipping. We are in constant contact with our manufacturers to bring you the latest updates.   Quality control is another issue we have faced in the past. To combat this, we will ask for periodic sampling and test out new colors with caution. We know what to look for and how to get there. However, we know that Plan A doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t always work and we always have a backup plan."
16733,project_016674,boyfierce,bazaar-1,An all in one mobile app to to make holding and finding Yard Sales easier!,Technology,City of Gold Coast | AU,False,52396.2555,36.5516278368,4.0,1562575083.0,1562623273.0,1565215273.0,False,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,,Hey! My name is Nathanial Tarrant. I'm 30 years old and I am absolutely obsessed with technology. I'm a singer and run my own web design business. Fierce Media.,1.0,2019-07-08 04:34:39 -0400,Backed 0 projects,"City of Gold Coast, AU",KO,"I remember when I was a young boy in the 90's, my dad and I would get up early every Saturday, get in the car and find the newspaper with all of the Yard Sales in our area. Dad would crack out the ol' street directory (kids, that is a physical book, with every road in the area where you have look up the street, find the corresponding page and map coordinates. Oh man, even writing this is a pain to do... anyway) then we'd be on our way to the first house! I loved spending this time with my dad, rummaging through other peoples stuff. But when it came to those moments when you have no cash, we'd have to go find an ATM (and in the early 90's in a beachside town, that wasn't an easy task). ÃÂÃÂ Spending this time with my dad definitely enhanced our relationship growing up.ÃÂÃÂ    Bazaar is here to make these time consumers a thing of the past.ÃÂÃÂ    So what is ÃÂÃÂ Bazaar?  Bazaar will be a FREE all-in-one mobile application that allows you to create an account and post a free classified ad for your Yard Sale, attach photos of what you have to sell, share you address and starting time.ÃÂÃÂ   Bazaar uses tags to make it easier for buyers to find exactly what they're looking for like furniture, clothing and kids toys.  Do you ever get those Early Birds who arrive at your door at 5am when your signs clearly say 7am? Well Bazaar will let you hide your address until the time your Yard Sale starts.  Users will be able to click on the address of the Yard Sales they want to visit and Bazaar will send that information to your preferred navigation app, for easy turn by tun navigation.  In future releases of Bazaar, we want to keep the navigation native within Bazaar. This will allow users to choose multiple Yard Sales and Bazaar will automatically create a route with all of their chosen addresses.ÃÂÃÂ   Speaking of future releases, we will integrate a cashless payment system ridding the need to visit an ATM. The seller will input the total amount into Bazaar's POS system creating a QR Code. The buyer will open their Bazaar app, and scan the QR code. Bazaar will deduct that amount from the users stored credit card. At the end of the sale, the Seller can deposit their earnings directly into their account. This feature will prevent money theft.ÃÂÃÂ          So, What's Next?   Bazaar is ready to start development. At our Funding Goal, we will be able to create the app with the basic features. With more funding comes more features allowing us to move forward faster than expected.ÃÂÃÂ   Every dollar bring Bazaar closer and closer to your hands!  By 2022, I would love to see Bazaar reach 3 millions downloads. This would be such an amazing feat.ÃÂÃÂ    Connect to our social media channels to keep up to date with more Bazaar news.   Website  -  Facbook  -  Twitter ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  At this point in time, our biggest risk is not receiving enough funding to get bazaar off the ground. With an app like this which, at its full potential, is very feature rich, keeping to schedule has the potential to become a hurdle. Our time management skills will be put to the test, but with your trust behind us, we know we can make that leap."

Risks and challenges  Risks and challenges Product Development    Product Development:    The Horti design and molding processes are finished. So, before launching the Kickstarter Project, we had already taken the Horti off the drawing board. We are guessing that a large production of Horti for Kickstarter backers take more than a 3months .    Production    From our previous experience in designing and product managing new consumer products, we are sure that we'll get Horti produced within 3month. Although we do not foresee delays in production, but quality control reasons sometimes require a temporary production break in order to make sure that only top quality products are shipped. But these delays are no more than 3or 4 weeks.    Distribution    We know that distribution might become a significant challenge because we will ship Horti to all worldwide ."

We are in the market for more than two years now and gained a valuable experience about manufacturing, packing, customer service and international shipping. We are already in touch with manufacturers for Lyra and arranged the production. Lyra can get into production straight after the funds are received. As the founder of Creoqode, I strongly believe that risks involved for on time delivery of Lyra will be extremely unlikely.  However, it would be fair to note that we will be shipping the product globally, and the taxation, customs duties and other regulations might be different across some countries which might cause some minor delays. However, Creoqode team has extensively researched global delivery of Lyra and partnered up with DHL in order to preempt any challenges we may face. Additionally, we have set the delivery date as December 2019 leaving us plenty of time to ensure on-time delivery.  Additionally, we will be putting all our effort to prepare detailed and easy to follow guidelines for hardware and software side of the product. However, after the delivery of Lyra, some users might still have questions regarding technical aspects of the product or might require assistance, which Creoqode help desk formed of 3 programmers and 2 electrical engineers will be able to answer immediately. We are all prepared for you to have an exciting and smooth experience with Lyra.  For any enquiries, please do not hesitate to contact us at  info@creoqode.com"

After weeks of running after my 3 year old on his dirt bike I had enough. I searched the internet for any ideas. All I could find was videos of kids crashing, dads running next to kids, and a few dads that tied a rope to the back of a dirt bike.ÃÂÃÂ   So I created BESS.    WHAT IS BESS   It helps parents stay in control and gives kids the chance to learn how to ride. Simply download the App to your Smartphone, connect to BESS, and you can use the ON/OFF buttons to control your kids ride. Bluetooth has about a 100 foot range. If your child goes out of range, don't worry BESS will automatically turn off your kids ride. BESS has a rechargeable battery so you can install it on anything.ÃÂÃÂ     WHAT WILL BESS WORK ON   Dirt bikes  ATVs  Go Karts  Power Wheels  And More!!                       WHAT STAGE IS THE PROJECT IN? ÃÂÃÂ    What you see in the picture is a real working prototype and the video is BESS in action not something edited    The hardware and software are complete    I have several working prototypes    I have built the App to control BESS    I have been testing BESS for months now (I wanted to make sure it will do its job and keep the kids safe)    WHAT NEXT? ÃÂÃÂ   I could start a website or go on amazon and sell BESS but I have high expectations and do not believe that I will be able to keep up with the demand of hand making every single BESS. If the project is funded with kickstarter I will use the money to have BESS manufactured so I can take this from a good idea to a great product. After that I hope to sell BESS online and have it available at local motorcycle or powersports dealerships.   BACK BESS ON KICKSTARTER SO WE CAN PROTECT WHAT MATTERS!!                                                 Risks and challenges  One of the main challenges I have faced is that my #1 job is DAD.  I worked hard on this project and have completed every step by myself. I took my idea to a group of engineers to see how much it would cost to build. I was surprised to hear $50,000 just to build a prototype and another $50,000 to take to market. So I learned to code, build Apps, 3D print, and much more. Now I have several working prototypes and I am ready for Manufacturing. I truly believe BESS will help parents and children everywhere. By backing this project you will help BESS go from a good idea to a great product."

Wir haben in den vergangenen Jahren den weltweit umfassendsten, leistungsstÃÂÃÂ¤rksten und intelligentesten Luftanalysator entwickelt ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> Made in Germany.ÃÂÃÂ    Nun ist er reif fÃÂÃÂ¼r die Serie und Sie kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen sich auf Kickstarter Ihren air-Q sichern.   air-Q ÃÂÃÂ¼berwacht mit einer Vielzahl an Sensoren  alle  Bestandteile der Luft, das Raumklima sowie UmwelteinflÃÂÃÂ¼sse ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> in Echtzeit (ca. 1,5 Sekunden-Intervall). Der air-Q analysiert dabei mit wissenschaftlicher PrÃÂÃÂ¤zision alle Daten fortlaufend und bietet so wirklich individuelle und wertvolle LÃÂÃÂ¶sungen fÃÂÃÂ¼r ein gesÃÂÃÂ¼nderes Leben und produktiveres Arbeiten.ÃÂÃÂ    Denn: Wir atmen mehr als 20.000 Mal ein und aus ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> jeden Tag. Da ist es gut zu wissen, was in der Luft liegt.        Unser air-Q denkt weiter und geht weiter als jedes andere LuftmessgerÃÂÃÂ¤t. So unterscheidet air-Q die MessgrÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂ<U+009F>en durch dezidierte Sensoren. Ein Beispiel: Anders als air-Q differenzieren viele andere MessgerÃÂÃÂ¤te nicht zwischen VOC und Kohlenstoffdioxid (COÃÂ¢<U+0082><U+0082>). Der eCOÃÂ¢<U+0082><U+0082>-Wert ist dort nur eine extrem grobe SchÃÂÃÂ¤tzung oder wird gar nicht erst mit einbezogen - anders beim air-Q.   air-Q vereint noch weit mehr:  Er ist auch als Rauchmelder und LÃÂÃÂ¤rmpegelmesser einsetzbar. Durch Algorithmen, welche im Hintergrund laufen, kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen zudem Stoffe und Situationen erkannt werden, welche so bisher nicht erfassbar waren, wie zum Beispiel:    air-Q sagt Schimmel treffsicher vorher      Die Anwesenheit von Menschen im Raum lÃÂÃÂ¤sst sich erkennen      GeÃÂÃÂ¶ffnete Fenster werden erfasst      Zeitliche ZusammenhÃÂÃÂ¤nge werden automatisch bestimmt und in die Auswertung einbezogen    Mit den umfassenden Daten des air-Q kann erstmals ÃÂÃÂ¼berhaupt eine ernsthafte Ursachenanalyse durchgefÃÂÃÂ¼hrt werden.ÃÂÃÂ        Luftdaten erfassen  air-Q kann ÃÂÃÂ¼berall aufgestellt werden ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> im Wohnzimmerregal, auf dem Kinderzimmer-Sideboard, im Schlafzimmer auf dem Nachttisch oder auf dem Schreibtisch im BÃÂÃÂ¼ro. Wichtig ist nur: Die Daten sollten dort erfasst werden, wo Sie und Ihre Familie oder Arbeitskollegen sich am meisten aufhalten.ÃÂÃÂ        Gesundheit und Leistung  air-Q analysiert fortlaufend alle Stoffe der lokalen Atemluft und bewertet den Einfluss auf die kÃÂÃÂ¶rperliche Gesundheit und LeistungsfÃÂÃÂ¤higkeit. Auf Basis von Grenzwerten des Umweltbundesamtes, Empfehlungen der WHO sowie wissenschaftlichen Studien, berechnet air-Q einen Gesundheitsindex und einen Leistungsindex. So werden die komplexen ZusammenhÃÂÃÂ¤nge verstÃÂÃÂ¤ndlich aufbereitet und fÃÂÃÂ¼r jeden bewertbar.   ÃÂÃÂ  air-Q Gesundheitsindex:  Tun Sie Ihrer Gesundheit etwas Gutes, indem Sie jederzeit wissen, wie sich die aktuelle Luft auf Ihr Wohlbefinden und die Gesundheit auswirkt und wie sich die LuftqualitÃÂÃÂ¤t verbessern lÃÂÃÂ¤sst.    ÃÂÃÂ  air-Q Leistungsindex:  Bleiben Sie fit und konzentriert beim Arbeiten durch die exakte Auswertung Ihrer Raumluft und individueller Tipps fÃÂÃÂ¼r eine optimale BÃÂÃÂ¼roluft.   Die Indexe werden auf dem air-Q durch LEDs angezeigt. Im lebensbedrohlichen Bereich lÃÂÃÂ¶st der air-Q einen akustischen Alarm aus ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> zum Beispiel bei Rauch- oder Kohlenmonoxid-Belastung. Wer mehr wissen mÃÂÃÂ¶chte, kann in der App jeden einzelnen Wert im Detail untersuchen.        Daten in der App auswerten  Die air-Q App ist Ihre Zentrale fÃÂÃÂ¼r den tÃÂÃÂ¤glichen LuftqualitÃÂÃÂ¤ts-Check ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> unkompliziert und 24/7 abrufbar. Unsere intelligente air-Q App liefert Ihnen nicht nur einen Rundumblick zur LuftqualitÃÂÃÂ¤t auf Ihr iOS oder Android-Smartphone. Mit Hilfe der air-Q App werden alle Informationen des air-Q zusammengetragen, verarbeitet und visualisiert. Die App besitzt dabei drei Hauptfunktionen.        1.  Die Zusammenfassung der Raumluftdaten findet ÃÂÃÂ¼ber den air-Q Gesundheits- und den air-Q Leistungsindex statt. Beide Indexe geben einen leicht verstÃÂÃÂ¤ndlichen ÃÂ<U+009C>berblick. Auch werden direkt Tipps zur Verbesserung der individuellen Luftsituation gegeben.   2.  Die Datenanalyse erlaubt ein tieferes Einsteigen in die einzelnen Luftbestandteile und deren HintergrÃÂÃÂ¼nde. Jede MessgrÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂ<U+009F>e kann verglichen und im Verlauf betrachtet werden. Auch gibt es alle Informationen zu jedem Stoff verstÃÂÃÂ¤ndlich aufbereitet. Die umfassende ÃÂ<U+009C>bersicht aller Grenzwerte erlaubt eine genaue EinschÃÂÃÂ¤tzung der eigenen Luftsituation. So viel MÃÂÃÂ¼he hat sich bisher niemand gemacht.   3.  Die App ist Ihr individueller Gesundheitsberater. Fortlaufend wertet sie im Hintergrund die verschiedenen Daten zu Gasen und Partikeln aus und kann auch AuÃÂ<U+009F>enluft-Daten mit einbeziehen. Jede Situation besitzt eine einzigartige Signatur, die sich oft durch die Kombination von verschiedenen Sensordaten identifizieren lÃÂÃÂ¤sst. ÃÂ<U+009C>ber die Zeit wird der air-Q Gesundheitsberater immer smarter, da er die individuellen Daten immer besser zu verstehen lernt.ÃÂÃÂ         Gesundheitsbewusste Menschen:  Sie erhalten umfassende und transparente Informationen ÃÂÃÂ¼ber das wichtigste Lebensmittel ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> die Atemluft.   Allergiker:  Sie werden frÃÂÃÂ¼hzeitig gewarnt, wenn belastende und kritische Luftsituationen Allergien auslÃÂÃÂ¶sen oder verstÃÂÃÂ¤rken kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen.   Familien:  Kinder sind besonders anfÃÂÃÂ¤llig fÃÂÃÂ¼r Schadstoffbelastungen. air-Q kann dazu beitragen, dass Ihre Kinder von Allergien verschont bleiben und in einer Umgebung mit gesunder Luft aufwachsen.   Senioren:  ÃÂ<U+0084>ltere Menschen sind, genau wie Kinder, anfÃÂÃÂ¤lliger fÃÂÃÂ¼r Schadstoffe jeglicher Art. Durch die einfach zu verstehende Lichtampel am air-Q ist es auch weniger Technik versierten Menschen mÃÂÃÂ¶glich, den air-Q zu nutzen.ÃÂÃÂ    Smart Home-Nutzer:  Technikbegeisterten Menschen bietet air-Q zahlreiche MÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeiten zur intelligenten Vernetzung des Zuhauses oder BÃÂÃÂ¼ros. Er interagiert unkompliziert mit den Sprachassistenten von Google und Amazon. Diese Integration werden wir durch Softwareupdates stetig erweitern.ÃÂÃÂ    Forscher und Datenanalytiker:  FÃÂÃÂ¼r Zwecke der eigenen Datenauswertung in Drittanbietersoftware (Excel, Statistikprogramme) bietet der air-Q eine eigene API fÃÂÃÂ¼r den direkten Datenzugriff in Echtzeit.   Unternehmen:  air-Q leistet einen entscheidenden Beitrag fÃÂÃÂ¼r das betriebliche Gesundheitsmanagement sowie das Wohlbefinden und die Effizienz Ihrer Mitarbeiter. Mit dem air-Q Gesundheitsindex und air-Q Leistungsindex erhalten Sie zwei wichtige Impulsgeber fÃÂÃÂ¼r eine nachhaltige BÃÂÃÂ¼roluft.       Ihre Luft- und Umgebungsdaten sind persÃÂÃÂ¶nlich. Deshalb gehen wir verantwortungsvoll mit ihnen um. Der air-Q speichert alle Ihre Daten lokal auf dem GerÃÂÃÂ¤t in einem austauschbaren SD-Speicher. Die Daten kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen bei Bedarf durch die Entnahme der SD-Karte ausgelesen werden. Sie kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen Ihre Daten natÃÂÃÂ¼rlich auch automatisch ÃÂÃÂ¼ber die air-Q App herunterladen und in der App verwenden. Wir haben darauf geachtet, dass Sie mÃÂÃÂ¶glichst unabhÃÂÃÂ¤ngig sind, d.h. der air-Q Ihnen die allermeisten Funktionen bietet ohne Internetzwang. Die Daten verlassen dabei Ihr Zuhause oder Ihr BÃÂÃÂ¼ro nicht ohne Ihre Zustimmung, d. h. sie werden nicht ins Internet ÃÂÃÂ¼bertragen!  Es gibt Funktionen, welche es allerdings erforderlich machen, dass die Daten ins Internet ÃÂÃÂ¼bertragen werden, um zu funktionieren. Hierzu zÃÂÃÂ¤hlen beispielsweise der Fernzugriff auf Ihre Echtzeitdaten, Fernalarme, der Zugriff auf unser Webinterface mit den dort umfangreichen MÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeiten zur Datenauswertung, Nutzung von Sprachassistenten und andere. FÃÂÃÂ¼r die Nutzung dieser Dienste fÃÂÃÂ¤llt ein geringer Betrag pro Monat an, da fortlaufend Daten auf unsere Server ÃÂÃÂ¼bertragen werden mÃÂÃÂ¼ssen. Ihre Daten werden dann verschlÃÂÃÂ¼sselt ÃÂÃÂ¼bertragen und auf physisch in Deutschland stehenden Servern gespeichert.

Dies wollten wir genauer wissen, fanden aber nichts Passendes auf dem Markt. Also haben wir mit air-Q den Luftanalysator entwickelt, den wir immer haben wollten. Unsere Mission: Einfach und immer wissen, was aktuell in der Luft liegt, um gesund und ohne Bedenken ein- und ausatmen zu kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen.ÃÂÃÂ              Dr. Daniel Lehmann ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> der Ideengeber:  FÃÂÃÂ¼r ihn spielen die Themen Gesundheit und Fitness eine bedeutende Rolle. Aus privatem Interesse und mangels VerfÃÂÃÂ¼gbarkeit von LÃÂÃÂ¶sungen hat er 2016 die Idee eines Multigas-Sensors entwickelt, der die Parameter der Luft einfach und schnell aber dennoch prÃÂÃÂ¤zise und zuverlÃÂÃÂ¤ssig bestimmt. Beim Bau der ersten Version des air-Q hat ihm seine ÃÂÃÂ¼ber 10-jÃÂÃÂ¤hrige Erfahrung in der Grundlagenforschung und der Entwicklung neuer Sensortechnologien an der Technischen UniversitÃÂÃÂ¤t Chemnitz sehr geholfen.             Mario KÃÂÃÂ¶rÃÂÃÂ¶si ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> der Strippenzieher:  Mario mÃÂÃÂ¶chte jedem die MÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeit geben, selbststÃÂÃÂ¤ndig die QualitÃÂÃÂ¤t der Luft zu messen. Deshalb war er schon frÃÂÃÂ¼h von der Idee zum air-Q begeistert und bringt sein wirtschaftliches Know-how mit ein. Er selbst liebt es, die Daten in den zahlreichen air-Q Charts zu verfolgen und die Ursachen fÃÂÃÂ¼r schlechte Luft aufzudecken.  AuÃÂ<U+009F>erdem ist Mario leider geplagt von Allergien. Seitdem er sich mit dem Thema Luftanalyse befasst, hat er endlich eine ErklÃÂÃÂ¤rung, was die Ursachen sein kÃÂÃÂ¶nnten. Er will nun auf jeden Fall vermeiden, dass auch seine Kinder Allergien bekommen. Mit dem air-Q hat jeder sein eigenes kleines Labor und kann selbst entscheiden.             Alexander Stinka ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> der Software-Entwickler:  Der air-Q misst jeden Tag unzÃÂÃÂ¤hlige Daten aus der Umgebungsluft ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> Alexander will nicht, dass die Nutzer mit dieser Flut allein gelassen werden. Er bringt sie in Form, und zwar mit der air-Q App. An dem modernen und intuitiv nutzbaren Interface sowie den wertvollen Gesundheits- und Leistungsindizes ist seine Entwickler-Expertise sofort zu erkennen. Er feilt bereits an weiteren genialen Features fÃÂÃÂ¼r den Gesundheitsassistenten der air-Q App. Was er derzeit am spannendsten findet: Dass sich in der Smart Home-Evolution immer mehr MÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeiten fÃÂÃÂ¼r den air-Q erÃÂÃÂ¶ffnen.       Den wirtschaftlichen Rahmen fÃÂÃÂ¼r den air-Q bietet die Corant GmbH mit Sitz in Chemnitz und Leipzig. Corant entstand als AusgrÃÂÃÂ¼ndung aus dem Institut fÃÂÃÂ¼r Physik der TU Chemnitz, das sich mit neuartigen Sensortechnologien befasst. Mit dieser Kompetenz entwickelt Corant SensorlÃÂÃÂ¶sungen, die einen Unterschied machen. Gemeinsam mit dem Lehrstuhl Mess- und Sensortechnik an der Technischen UniversitÃÂÃÂ¤t Chemnitz liegt der Fokus auf der Weiterentwicklung von Atemluft- und Gasanalyse-Technologien.

Durch technische Schwierigkeiten beim Elektronikdesign und EngpÃÂÃÂ¤sse in der Produktion kann es zu VerzÃÂÃÂ¶gerungen bei der Auslieferung kommen.  Wir haben unsere Kickstarter Kampagne bereits lange geplant, bewusst jedoch bis zum heutigen Tag gewartet, um fÃÂÃÂ¼r unsere UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzer und Backer mÃÂÃÂ¶glichst viele Risikofaktoren auszuschlieÃÂ<U+009F>en oder zumindest stark zu reduzieren. So konnten wir bereits alle Kernfunktionen ausgiebig testen.   Bei uns befinden sich mehrere funktionierende Prototypen im Einsatz - teilweise seit ÃÂÃÂ¼ber einem Jahr. Auch bei einigen Testern (Kindergarten, Abendlokal, zu Hause, BÃÂÃÂ¼ros) konnte der air-Q schon erprobt werden. Wir konnten die Mobil-App seit lÃÂÃÂ¤ngerem im Realeinsatz testen und Feedback von unseren Testen sammeln (was uns auch dazu bewegt hat das optische Design zu verÃÂÃÂ¤ndern ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> technisch bleibt alles wie es bisher ist und funktioniert). Die Firmware hat sich ÃÂÃÂ¼ber die vergangenen Monate kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt und ist stabil.  Auch die Webanwendung besitzt bereits die meisten Funktionen.   Jetzt sind wir an einem Punkt an dem wir Ihre UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzung bei Kickstarter benÃÂÃÂ¶tigen, um die letzten Schritte gemeinsam zu gehen und den air-Q zu produzieren."

If you have any questions, check out our FAQ or shoot us an email at empoweredbythesun@gmail.com.       We are on a mission to bring solar energy education across the country and empower people of all ages to envision and start realizing a brighter future!ÃÂÃÂ Pun intended.       We will travel via Sunny, the solar powered van, to demonstrate that solar energy is a viable and readily accessible energy alternative and  we need your support  to get this project rolling, literally! ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ             After a thorough research all of our 50 state's educational standards, we were surprised to find a lack of standards relating to renewable energy. The majority of them do not require in-depth renewable energy education and the instruction on the subject of solar energy is mostly limited to students enrolled in Career and Technical Education programs, a.k.a. vocational schools.ÃÂÃÂ      Only 3 states require their teachers to educate about solar energy!    We came to the conclusion that our students are not being prepared to face one of the most pressing issues of the 21st century: how to provide secure, reliable, clean, and affordable energy for future generations. However, we understand that teachers have a lot on their plate and school funding is unavailable sometimes. Teachers, don't fret. We got you!            We strongly believe that solar energy should be taught to children across the country as a means to meet our current and future energy needs. Therefore, we spent the past four years developing and testing a curriculum that bridges the existing educational gap.            Our curriculum includes information about  renewable energy ,  solar power ,  circuits , and how to make a circuit with solar power. The instruction is structured into a workshop that teaches our students how solar energy is harvested and how it can be used in an electrical and heating capacity.ÃÂÃÂ      Our students will have the opportunity to use this knowledge to construct a solar powered car.           The workshops will include videos and verbal information of the versatility of solar power as an energy source. Our students will work in teams to develop communication and critical thinking skills, but most important they will learn how to build electric circuits using solar power. This hands-on experience will enable them to fully grasp and understand the practical use of this renewable energy source!

To build-up their newly aquired skills, clubs will be provided with a new fun and exciting project to work on every school year. With the guidance of a teacher or mentor, they can enter and participate in a competition to showcase their project alongside other clubs all over the country and have a chance to win Best of the Year award and prizes!ÃÂÃÂ       Click on this image to start your very own EBS Club!     Not only will this expand their knowledge and capabilities, but it can spark an interest that could lead them to a variety of career opportunities within the growing solar energy industry. According to  James Hamilton , an economist in the Office of Occupational Statistics and Employment Projections of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the industry employs a wide range of occupations in a number of major industry segments: research and development, manufacturing of solar power materials, construction of solar power plants, operation of solar power plants, and solar power installation and maintenance.     We see a bright future for our students!         Ours is a very clear mission: to spread practical knowledge of solar energy across the country and reach as many students as possible. We will travel coast to coast driven solely by the power of the sun to empower our students to create a brighter future for themselves and their communities.ÃÂÃÂ      Our students love our workshops and we love to brighten their day!    After receiving our workshops, our students will share their experience with their parents, family, and friends. Imagine all the people that we will impact directly and indirectly, and that is without mentioning the impression that Sunny will have on them!       Not only will ""Sunny"" the Solar Powered Van be a testament of how renewable energy can supply our energy needs, but it will demonstrate that we can do anything we put our minds to. Three years ago we came up with this dream and today we are so close to making it a reality that we can almost feel it!       We quit our jobs to dedicate ourselves to this project and have shed some serious blood, sweat, and tears into it. We have developed the curriculum, went through all the legal work, acquired the van and electric motor vehicle parts, received the solar panels, and put a down payment to convert the van to electric. However, we need your help to finish what we started!     We are only limited by our imagination!     To reach our goal, we are bringing our individual and combined skills to the table to provide rewards that add value to our donors and their community. Will is a professional photographer and videographer, known by the pseudonym DJ Chill Will, and Margarita is a creative spirit and sewing enthusiast; both of whom enjoy the outdoors and are thrilled to share with all of you the fruits of our labor in order to make this project a reality.     Will is honored to share his photography and videography skills with all our donors!    We are only asking for the funds necessary to start our project, however we firmly believe that everybody deserves to understand and be able to use solar energy. Raising additional funds would enable us to offer our workshops to any and all students regardless of their socioeconomic background.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ      Margarita is a big creative force behind this project and her sewing skills are on [needle] point!    Any supplemental funds raised would enable us to acquire the materials and resources necessary to impact as many students as possible, help fund student clubs and rewards, all while maintaining a fun and exciting curriculum.     Approximately every $250 donated is another school we can reach.    ÃÂÃÂ  EACH SOLAR PANEL IS A SCHOOL SUNNY COULD VISIT THANKS TO YOUR DONATIONS*!   Together we can empower our students to create a brighter future and we truly cannot wait to hit the road on our solar powered van to commence our workshops and start spreading the word of what solar energy education can do for our students, their community, and our country.ÃÂÃÂ Every dollar brings us closer to another school, so what are you waiting for?ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ JOIN US IN OUR EFFORTS AND BECOME EMPOWERED BY THE SUN!

Fortunately, we have been devoting our time and energy into this project for over four years and have spent ample time as a team and with consultants to reduce these risks. Firstly, we already own the van and we have the solar panels that will power it (a big thank you to ESA Solar for those panels). Instead of converting the van ourselves to be solar electric, we are working with a professional (BH Electrics) who has converted over 10 vehicles previously so that it is done correctly and according to our schedule.  This segues into the transportation problem. Unlike most people, we have a vehicle that just needs sun to go. The range is limited to 200 miles on a charge, but we will use this information to plan our routes so that we arrive to each destination on time and ready to have some fun. In addition, our solar powered vehicle (Sunny) allows us to bring the materials to each workshop so that we make sure we have everything we need and it does not need to be shipped (in addition to the environmental benefit of not using fossil fuels to send materials). Our logistics are planned out ahead of time and with plenty of wiggle room to account for cloudy days and other unforseen issues.   Gathering funds is currently our largest obstacle, and is why we made this Kickstarter campaign. We know that most people are unaware of the lack of electricity and solar power education in the United States and are also unfamiliar with us and what we do. This campaign is a great tool to show them what we are all about so that we can seriously fund our nonprofit work.   The audience is always difficult for anyone to engage. Fortunately, Will has been designing this curriculum so that workshop attendees really don't have much choice. They will be building the circuits and working with solar with their own two hands, this is no lecture! We have a great track record of engaging workshops and curriculum and our testimonials attest to that. Plus, over the past four years, Will has been able to actually test these kits and these workshops with real students and refine them so that they engage and educate the most.  Regarding metrics, we have different surveys that are given to each teacher after we leave so that we can get information from them and the students so as to assess our engagement and our results. These surveys also help us improve our workshops. Our online curriculum has digital metrics that are easy to see and display, and we will use those to update our inquisitive supporters."

A B2B company.ÃÂÃÂ        Did you know that almost 100% of cosmetic packaging, especially plastic packaging goes to landfill?   This is why .  1. cosmetic products use excessive heavy packaging for design perspective such as coating, printing, deposition.  2. Used bottles are very hard to clean it because content mostly contain oil and it requires a great amount of water for rinsing.    But our current recycling process can't solve these problem, impossible to realize circular economy.                   INNERBOTTLE leaves no residue, nothing but a clean empty bottle after use, and we provide a  recycle and reuse friendly  packaging.        INNERBOTTLE can solve ÃÂÃÂ problems above and it is  beneficial for both us and for Earth .ÃÂÃÂ                   Innerbottle solution leaves less than 2% of residue. This not only provides satisfied user experience but also contributes environment protection.ÃÂÃÂ                The most important function of container is to preserve content safely without any denaturation. With  Dual layer  and  Diffusion Barrier EffectÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ , Innerbottle prevents oxidation and denaturation of content, keeping it safe till the final use.               Innerbottle is made of 100% BPA-free silicone which is specially formulated, which is non-toxic keeping the content safe.ÃÂÃÂ             Innerbottle keeps the outer shell clean thus contributes to environment by reducing water while cleaning the bottle to recycle it .               Innerbottle is made of specially formulated silicone which can be totally incinerated or recycled to silicone oil. So as we recycle every part, it goes circular and keeps the world sustainable.          Let's run a simulation supposing that we bought a product having 100ml (3.38Oz.) for $30 which has medium viscosity.       You can also run a simulation by clicking the image         The result is truly surprising.               Since silicone can be either recycled or incinerated completely leaving nothing but ash, and the outer packaging(empty bottle) requires minimum cleansing, the outer packaging can be used again.  Our  Re-Turn  program is done by cooperating with Cosmetic Brands. After consumers finish using their products, empty bottles are collected by Cosmetic Brands and they are sent to INNERBOTTLE.  At INNERBOTTLE, Innerbottle (Inner-packaging) are separated and recycled and empty outer shells are sent to reusing facilities where they are rinsed with minimum water.  And we are making progress setting the system.       Our sustainable concept was highly encouraged by each organization as below. We would like to share stories with our backers, and we hope you could support us too.   Innerbottle participated in K-Start 2018, the largest Start-up competition in Korea and won the first prize(Presidential award) by achieving recognition of possibilities in reducing resources, recycling materials, to make Circular Economy.        Innerbottle made a presentation at Sustainable Cosmetic Summit 2019, on 8-10th May in New York City this year. We were gathered to talk about the current environmental issues and seek for solution to make our world sustainable. Changing the economy from linear to circular, we need to see the whole industry from a different point of view, focused on 'sustainability'. And we believe our solution can motivate the world to be more responsible helping them to make a better choice.ÃÂÃÂ         Innerbottle also has been awarded as the Startup Of The Year at IN_PACT ASIA 2019 held in Manila, hosted by Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Asia Society for Social Improvement and Social Transformation (ASSIST). This meant a lot to us, and we will try to move further.ÃÂÃÂ         And recently, we've won a Red Dot in Red Dot Award 2019 by the concept of Eco friendly packaging solution.            We have just started our mass manufacture but we are still a small team.

For carers the most stressful thing shall be getting the elders lost accidentally. However, with tracking system, you won't have such worry by simply following a few steps: ÃÂÃÂ   (1) Download an app  (2) Set the alert distance between the carer and the elder: ( a) 1-2 m ; (b) 5-7 m; (c) 12-15 m  (3) When you are out of the alert distance range, your mobile will ring loudly  (4) Open the app and you will get the last location of the elder right after s/he is out of the alert distance  For example, one day Victoria goes to the supermarket with her mum with our power wheelchair and she spots that there is a super sale corner. She runs to the corner immediately as usual and when she is about to take a look of the one piece, she hears an alarm quite annoying...Gosh! She leaves mum behind! Thanks to the tracking system.

If the tracking system is the 1st protection, then the GPS tracking system will be the 2nd protection to avoid missing the elder in a longer distance range: ÃÂÃÂ   (1) Same as the BLE tracking system, you have to download an app for the GPS tracking  (2) Select the tracker by IMEI number, you can then define the tracking location and boundary size or area.

WheelCare2 understands the needs of both the carers and the elders. We aim at providing a more considerate solution to show your care to the elders with our passionate engineering design. The double protection not only helps locate the elder physically but also relieves the stress of the carer mentally. The enhancement of the user experience for both parties in terms of better caring solution enables both sides can be well connected anytime, anywhere regardless of the distance.      Risks and challenges  Developing WheelCare2 involves lots of challenging electromechanical and software designs, such as lightweight with strong structural strength, combine size with foldable mechanism, battery life, ergonomic design and the wireless technologies embedded into the power wheelchair. We can foresee lots of testings from hardware to software to confirm the safety and the functionality."

Simply back the project and your name will be entered into our draw for the chance to win a brand new set of the latest Apple AirPods (postage paid for by us). The lucky winner will be announced if the project reaches its funding goal. Don't miss out and stay tuned for the announcement!ÃÂÃÂ     Overview   ROMA Surveys has one aim and one aim only - to improve the way market research is conducted and ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦ and ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦..ÃÂÃÂ   Ok, so maybe not just one aimÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦    So what do we ACTUALLY do?   Simply put, ROMA Surveys offers a user-friendly survey platform for local and online businesses to research, engage and connect with the 18-25 year old population.ÃÂÃÂ   Both on a local and national level, not only can our researchers benefit from targeted survey responses, they can also build their online presence to both current and potential consumers - through the use of our targeted user base and promoter websites. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Once signed up, these companies are able to create survey campaigns that are then distributed across a network of promoter websites relevant to the business, to be completed by anyone who has signed up as a user on our platform.ÃÂÃÂ        We believe data usage for marketing purposed isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t always ethical and with many social media platforms using your data without your acknowledgement, we want to show there's a way to transparently collect data for our researchers, in exchange for rewards we give to you!ÃÂÃÂ     SURVEY FUNCTIONALITY   We are not just your standard survey site.ÃÂÃÂ   Have you ever tried to complete a survey online in order to reap the financial rewards? Have you ever got a financial reward that was worth the time and payout received?ÃÂÃÂ   ROMA Surveys only allows companies to create surveys with a maximum of 10 short multiple-choice questions. Each survey typically lasts between 10-120 seconds. ÃÂÃÂ    The best news? Per completed survey, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll get paid 50p INSTANTLY into your PayPal account.ÃÂÃÂ       How It Works - A simple and transparent process      PAYOUTS AND FEES     How do our prices come about?ÃÂÃÂ    Believe it or not, we didnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t just pluck these figures out of thin air. We knew our goal from the start was to ensure we positively impacted the market research industry and anyone involved within it. So of course, that meant beating ALL our competitors prices.  USERS:  Usually, when signing up to other survey sites, payouts vary between ÃÂÃÂ£0.01p and ÃÂÃÂ£0.10p for shorter surveys. For longer surveys payouts can be slightly higher but can also take up to an hourÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s time.ÃÂÃÂ   With ROMA Surveys, we make sure all our surveys take less than 2 minutes to complete and allow users to achieve payouts of ÃÂÃÂ£0.50p per survey.ÃÂÃÂ        PROMOTERS:  Similar to users, payouts for promoters are usually between ÃÂÃÂ£0.01p and ÃÂÃÂ£0.10p for each advert click. With ROMA Surveys, promoters are able to earn ÃÂÃÂ£0.20p.ÃÂÃÂ   WhatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s more is that promoters are able to choose which types of websites or blogs they would like to promote. For example, if you have an e-commerce site that sells dog toys, you can choose to promote your adverts to users who are interested in pets, allowing your surveys to match your unique content.ÃÂÃÂ         WEÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>RE DIFFERENT    We have four main USPs:   1. Instant payouts - earn up to ÃÂÃÂ£5 per day by using our platformÃÂÃÂ    Not only are our surveys unique to your interests and hobbies, but when you fill out 10 surveys a day, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll earn ÃÂÃÂ£5.00 which will go straight into your PayPal account the same day - itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s that simple. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s your lunch, on us!ÃÂÃÂ    2. We drive exposure for the companies that choose to create surveys on our platform.   It takes less than a few minutes to create a survey on our platform. Once the survey is published, itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s automatically featured to a multitude of websites and app owners who can choose to promote the survey in exchange for payouts from us! WhatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s more, the promoter is always relevant to the survey creator, allowing for their branding and survey to be exposed to potentially thousands of relevant, potential customers on the promoters website/app.ÃÂÃÂ    3. Our promoters who get paid for featuring our surveys also benefiting from increased traffic and content engagement.ÃÂÃÂ    For every ROMA Surveys user who completes a survey thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s promoted on your website/app, you get paid ÃÂÃÂ£0.20p thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s accessible whenever you want it. Furthermore, because users completing the survey are relevant for your website/app content, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll automatically gain increased engagement and coverage!ÃÂÃÂ    4. Creating a survey on our platform guarantees engagement with your content.ÃÂÃÂ    Companies and individuals who create a survey not only benefit from having their survey and branding advertised on verified and relevant websites/apps but additionally, our users completing surveys are also incentivised to visit the websites of those creating the survey. Through our ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0098>leads toolÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>, for gaining a higher survey reward limit per day, users are given the opportunity to view and engage with content and media created by the company or individual themselves.     ROMA Surveys User Homepage      Our plans for growth with your investmentÃÂÃÂ    If our campaign is successful, we plan to divide the funds with 50% for digital marketing and 50% for platform development. We love our product and we hope you will too which is why with our ÃÂÃÂ£10,000 marketing budget, we plan to boost our outreach, allowing for more students across the United Kingdom to earn and research with ROMA Surveys.ÃÂÃÂ   Our next big step is to build a reputable and active following in the United kingdom so that we may share the value of our platform to those living in Europe, United States of America and Asia.ÃÂÃÂ   In addition to this, 50% of our investment will be carefully spent on platform development, allowing us to create additional features and tools that will further increase the effectiveness and outreach of our researcher targeting, with API access available too. As well as this, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll provide users with capabilities to share their survey activity with friends in exchange for more rewards, integrate more payout options and create the ability to share ÃÂÃÂ payouts with your chosen charities.ÃÂÃÂ All development is facilitated by our trusted external developer team who have been building tailored platforms for over 20 years.ÃÂÃÂ   Finally, through the growing use of QR technology, we aim to create bigger and better incentives for customers to interact and support local businesses where they can earn ROMA credits to spend at their favourite brands.ÃÂÃÂ     Our final words to you   We aim to disrupt the outdated, inconvenient and unrewarding process of paid surveys by providing a rewarding and trustworthy environment where users, promoters and researchers are provided value and growth. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve already got a variety of startups, SMEs and PLCÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s strongly interested or already signed up on our platform as well as many users and publishers signed up to use our platform, all we need is your investment to make it happen. Market research and data targeting shouldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t be intimidating which is why, with your investment in us, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll not only build a platform thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s easy to use and highly effective, but weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll change the way the world sees boring surveys and ineffective digital marketing.ÃÂÃÂ      Invest in us today and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll reward you tomorrow.ÃÂÃÂ                         Risks and challenges  Businesses are the source of income for websites, users and ROMA which means they are crucial to the process. Not enough businesses mean fewer surveys, fewer people able to earn money and a negative reputation for the platform.   In the event of not enough businesses signing up, we will increase our business-to-business marketing and PR which is largely facilitated through our networks, both offline and online. Businesses can definitely benefit from ROMA more than anywhere else which indicates the issue is not ROMA being of less value but more specifically not having a strong reputation and extensive user base, yet.   With enough backers and an increase in our national coverage through news sites, social media and press, we believe the growth in user numbers will result in a hugely added incentive for even more businesses to sign up."

Risks and challenges  First starting the project my initial stop was the patent attorney. Finding out the project was completely unique was just the initial step. With the confirmed new idea  and every dime I had on a search I attempted to find ways for others to invest or ways I could get funding. Little did I know how much more effort and research I was about to have to put in. With the government allowing a bill for low income individuals to receive help with inventions I immediately jumped at the chance. The patent pro bono process over the last 6 years has been the greatest informational and productive path I have seen. Through the process I was given the opportunity to work hands on with Case Western University of Law making my product a class project. Working with many four-year law students and professors we were able to broaden the abilities of this product through multiple Industries, not just  the Green Industry for trees. Making this product sturdy enough to maintain more weight than expected has been very integral in our research. the product will have the ability to lift more than the apparatus (ex. skidsteer with forks)moving the object. (Ex. Trees) the apparatus will fail and tip off balance before our product fails.  Off-road abilities has been one of our key issues because trees are almost always off road at some point. The ability to be able to distribute the weight allowance of the item you are carrying has been critical in the development of this product to make it safer for everyone. This achieves our goals by our product making it safer, more time and labor efficient, and more reliable then current methods and products."

We appreciate the support of the crowdfunding community. To give a bit more background on the people behind this project, Adam and David are the co-founders of MIRAVAC and have been friends since childhood. Their paths crossed several times before they realized they need to make something out of it. Since one lives domestically and the other internationally, they decided to partner on this business when presented with this unique opportunity. The rest is history.                                          Risks and challenges  The Miravac team believes Kickstarter is the right platform to launch and bring our idea to life because this is where innovative ideas are welcomed and where the status quo is challenged. Although this involves risks, we believe these risks are worth it and we believe that our backers will support Miravac as an affordable and innovative technology that makes at-home robots more accessible to everyone. We understand that dirty floors will probably affect most peopleÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s lives at some point. Because of this, we believe the Loop and Swerve robots by Miravac are useful to everyone. To offset the risks and challenges involved with creating Miravac, we developed and tested 2 generations of prototypes using our experienced robotics team and quality product materials. We also spent considerable time measuring the many scenarios and preferences of our users to ensure that the product will address their needs. We also have secured patents and manufacturing relationships to make sure that we deliver Loop and Swerve to backers as quickly as possible.  Our goal is to minimize the chances of unforeseen production issues that sometimes can happen. Our brand stands for quality - a promise from our founders to each and every customer who supports us and our mission to make stress-free home cleaning faster, more realistic, and more affordable for all."

The word ""Nixie"" was formed from the words  N umeric  I ndicator e X erimental No.  1  ÃÂÃÂ and first introduced 1954 by Burroughs Corporation from USA as a brand name for numeric displays. Nixie tubes were used until the mid of the 1970's as numeric displays in measuring devices, calculators, TV sets and the very first computers. The evolution of modern style display types like Numitron, VFD, Light Emitting Diodes and Liquid Crystal Displays, which have a very low supply voltage (battery power supply) eliminated these Nixie tubes from the market, and they are not produced anymore. In the former USSR Nixie tubes were produced as surplus in vast quantities until the beginning of the 90's ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> and from this sources is this tube. But even these supplies are now running short. And when they're gone, they're gone. The tube is taken from ""NOS"", what means  N ew  O ld  S tock. They were never used before and spent their first thirty or more years forgotten in some Russian warehouse. The principle of the Nixie tubes is based on cold cathode discharge and it is used today a million times ÃÂÃÂ e.g. in small neon bulbs of illuminated mains power switches.  The Bargraph tube in the NixieTherm RGB is a special Russian construction of such a neon bulb, it can produce a current depending variable glow hight lenght when a current regulated voltage of around 140 VDC is applied.  Often I was asked: ""What is the lifespan of a Nixie tube"" and than there is a simple answer: ""Have a look at your illuminated power switch of the multiple outlet strip.

Please mail to: Mr.Nixie@Nixiekits.eu      Risks and challenges  The Story behind NixieTherm  The first version of the NixieTherm was introduced in 2011. In the meantime more than 950 devices has been sold.  After launching the NixieTherm SMD in 2018 on Kickstarter with successful crowdfounding, the remaining batch is now nearly sold out. So a new version needs to be created which considers many wished from the customers. This new PCB batch with build-in RGB controller needs to be ordered (and pre-financed for sure) with nearly fully SMD pre-assembled and soldered parts - and of course, a new enclosure design was created and needs also be ordered.  Fully hand made prototypes are working perfect, as you see in the photos / video.  ""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.""  In the meantime there are a lot of cheap copies - specially from Lithuania, Ukraine and - with faked accounts now also from Italy - on the market, but they have never reached the top quality of the German original Mr.Nixie's NixieTherm."

Free of doubts, you can now focus on your swing to Improve the mechanics and sharpen the feelings!ÃÂÃÂ                         Hi Kickstarters,  My name is Geoffroy Dardenne and today IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m very happy to share with you the Alignment Ball project. ÃÂÃÂ   I have designed the alignment ball because I needed it. When I discovered golf 6 years ago, my golf instructor kept saying: "" Hey Geo, if you want to improve your golf, you need to work on your alignment! The secret of a good golf shot is a good alignment""! So that's what I have been trying to do.ÃÂÃÂ I started looking for a cool and functional aid to improve my game, but I couldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t find one, so I created one myself!ÃÂÃÂ   ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s been a long way from the first sketch to the final sample...! I needed to add few improvements to my original design ;)ÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ When you are prototyping a new idea without being a big company, you're alone in the plane. There is no bank, no suppliers, no manufacturers to support you. You are by yourself and you need to be creative to make the idea grow. Fortunately, IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve met some very nice people along the way, who gave me their time, their energy, their passion to help me keep on going. Many thanks to them, my family and friends for all their support and love !  Design, print, test, design again... Meeting golfers from far and wide in order to have their feedback... design again until satisfaction! ÃÂÃÂ Find the best materials! Try to get some competent manufacturers involved to produce a high-quality golf tool! ÃÂÃÂ Invest in a mould! Manufacture the first perfect sample...! Launch a kickstarter campaign to start production! This is where I am, and this is where we meet!  If like me, you love the idea to improve your whole game with a cool and functional tool, support my campaign. Order the Alignment Ball now, enjoy the lowest price ever and receive it just in time for this summer.  Thank you for your support, enjoy your golf and never stop pushing your limits.  Geoffroy                               Risks and challenges  Creating and lauching a new product is a long way with many risks. This is the first time for us and even if sometimes we can't sleep at night, now, we are confident.  We have spend more than 1 year to find manufacturers, suppliers with whom we beleive we could delivery a high end  quality product. We have tested the prototypes in a harsh way  and we know now, we have a great, beautiful and resistant training aid . The feedbacks we have from pro's and amateurs who have try the Alignment Ball are more that exciting....  We know there's always unexpected challenges ! But we are truly passionates about golf and still have many energy to find solutions to rock any obstacle..  Anyway, if there's for some unknown reason some delay in the delivery, we will let you know and make our best for you to receive the Alignment ball as soon as possible."

Este proyecto consiste en el diseÃÂÃÂ±o y fabricaciÃÂÃÂ³n de un coche de carreras estilo FÃÂÃÂ³rmula que compite por Europa en unas competiciones llamadas Formula Student. Nosotros construimos un coche completamente elÃÂÃÂ©ctrico, y ademÃÂÃÂ¡s con tracciÃÂÃÂ³n a las cuatro ruedas. El prototipo en el que hemos estado trabajando este aÃÂÃÂ±o es el CAT12.  La Formula Student es la competiciÃÂÃÂ³n universitaria con mÃÂÃÂ¡s prestigio a nivel internacional. Consiste en una competiciÃÂÃÂ³n de ingenierÃÂÃÂ­a en la cual mÃÂÃÂ¡s de 700 equipos de mÃÂÃÂ¡s de 40 nacionalidades ponen a prueba el vehÃÂÃÂ­culo que han desarrollado durante la temporada. La competiciÃÂÃÂ³n estÃÂÃÂ¡ dividida en pruebas estÃÂÃÂ¡ticas y dinÃÂÃÂ¡micas donde los equipos tienen que demostrar su conocimiento y poner a prueba el vehÃÂÃÂ­culo en pista. La competiciÃÂÃÂ³n actualmente cuenta con 14 pruebas en todo el mundo y consta de tres categorÃÂÃÂ­as: Formula Student Combustion, Formula Student Electric y Formula Student Driverless.

DespuÃÂÃÂ©s de diseÃÂÃÂ±ar y construir cuatro vehÃÂÃÂ­culos con motor de combustiÃÂÃÂ³n, el equipo dio el paso a la categorÃÂÃÂ­a elÃÂÃÂ©ctrica en 2012 y desde entonces se han desarrollado ocho monoplazas elÃÂÃÂ©ctricos. Actualmente, el equipo ocupa el 15.ÃÂÃÂº lugar de 139 al ranking mundial de Formula Student Electric. Los ÃÂÃÂ©xitos conseguidos durante las ÃÂÃÂºltimas temporadas han permitido estar cada vez mÃÂÃÂ¡s cerca de los equipos punteros y la primera posiciÃÂÃÂ³n a la Formula Student Czech Republic 2016 convirtiÃÂÃÂ³ a ETSEIB Motorsport en el primer equipo del estado espaÃÂÃÂ±ol capaz de ganar una competiciÃÂÃÂ³n de Formula Student.

The ÃÂÃÂ  b free cup . ÃÂÃÂ© is an antibacterial menstrual cup made of 100% medical grade silicone and developed by Women's Global Health Innovations. It provides menstruators throughout the world with the freedom to live their lives, combining innovations in the design of both product and packaging. WGHI is trying to end period poverty so that we can all  bfree  to live and thrive.                 There are a lot of options out there targeting women and girls who can afford to buy sanitary products every month. For the other menstruators who are experiencing period poverty, the choices are extremely limited, and often those who can stand to benefit the most from reusable products have the hardest time accessing them.  Even most existing reusable options like reusable pads and traditional cups are not flexible enough for most menstruators. Bleeding ebbs as well as flows, with the female anatomy changing drastically for many during different parts of their cycle. Some lighter days on which only spotting occurs, a pad would be more than enough, but things can change in an instant. We want you to be prepared for the unprepared. That's why our signature tin comes with two cups to choose from. So go ahead and pick two!                 The  b free cup . ÃÂÃÂ© was not developed by men in suits and lab coats, but by a female entrepreneur who has seen first hand the effects of period poverty. After working in communities in the Global South, Leisa Hirtz founded Women's Global Health Innovations in Toronto, Canada to do her part in helping to eradicate period poverty. Through her work with WGHI doing research on the impacts access to sanitation and hygienic products had on school attendance, Leisa realized quickly that not enough actual innovation was being made to address the growing problem. Not only was there not enough investment in providing the existing menstrual hygiene management (MHM) solutions to those who needed it, the products themselves were having a negative impact on the environments of the people using them.  This is why from the beginning, WGHI has strived to improve outcomes for menstruators not only by providing access to a truly groundbreaking menstrual cup, but also by developing a product and business model that attempts to achieve many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).       The Sustainable Development Goals provide all UN member states with  ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>the blueprints to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ  With an emphasis on SDGs 3,4,5 and 12, the  b free cup . ÃÂÃÂ© brings us one step closer towards achieving the sustainable, equitable future we all aspire towards.            One of the driving forces behind the  b free cup . ÃÂÃÂ© is the knowledge that providing access to education empowers young girls and boys to reach their full potential.ÃÂÃÂ   Period poverty prevents this.  Improving Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) education is one of the pillars of our company. Menstrual cups, and menstrual hygiene in general, require knowledge of the female anatomy, and basic sanitary practices. Predictably, the taboo around the subject of menstruation assures there are no end to the questions menstruators have on the subject. We want to empower girls with knowledge that will keep them healthy and thriving, by provide quality education on SRH.  Our most successful programs to date have been in providing education through local advocates and educators. With a focus on menstruation and proper cup use and care, we have collaborated with local partners to train trainers who can go into rural, urban and peri-urban environments through our Training of Trainers program (ToT). We equip and work with locals who understand the community they are working in, providing them with the crucial information on female health and the highly specific knowledge surrounding menstrual cup and  b free cup . ÃÂÃÂ©care. Those who completed our ToT program bring sexual and reproductive health and rights education to classrooms, while we paint school latrines and provide clean water for sanitary conditions for menstrual hygiene management.                 The work we do in Toronto is informed by what we learn in places that couldn't be more different. Countries like Uganda, Kenya, Senegal and Rwanda, are just some of the places we've worked trying to understand the needs of women around the world.  We are always trying to keep up-to-date on cultural sensitivities surrounding menstruation globally, and it helps to build and expand our network of like minded people and organizations.  International collaboration is what has allowed bfree to flourish into the game changing health product that it has become.  With that in mind we are always looking to grow our team to keep bringing the  b free cup . ÃÂÃÂ© to communities around us, here in Canada, and throughout the world. Because period poverty is not just a problem in low and middle income countries. There are communities in every country that suffer from an unfair lack of access to affordable menstrual hygiene management. It's time to end that.       We work with advocates, educators and policy makers to bring substantive change to women's health and freedoms.   Public Health Ambassadors Uganada - PHAU    Womena    Days for Girls    ZanaAfrica             This is only a snapshot of the epic adventure that has been the development of the  b free cup . ÃÂÃÂ©  Through grants, loans and innovation competitions, WGHI has managed to develop truly ground breaking technology - 100% medical grade silicone that is antibacterial, and a cup with a completely unique, nature inspired design.  But these are just the first steps.       We need  your  help bringing the  b free cup . ÃÂÃÂ© into production. Your support will go towards the very expensive process of manufacturing moulds for menstrual cups here in Canada where we make the  b free cup . ÃÂÃÂ© Funds from our Kickstarter Campaign will also go towards the shipping and packaging costs for the storage tins and bags, so we can get you the absolute best product without compromising our vision of providing something affordable and of the highest quality. We have built relationships with local and international suppliers, and they are ready to go to production.  We are a for-profit company, and believe true sustainable development for low and middle income communities comes from providing economic opportunity, not financial or material given aid in perpetuity. That said, we work with NGOs and charitable organizations providing menstrual products to girls and women who need them most because period poverty is a crisis happening now. We maximize the social impact of our company by building educational programs.  We understand the importance of giving, and we want to provide you with the opportunity to give to those who need.  That's why we collaborated with The Period Purse, an amazing local organization working here in Toronto, that provides homeless women with essential hygiene products. If you choose the ""Buy a cup, give a cup"" reward, you won't just receive your very own  b free cup . ÃÂÃÂ©, we will also provide one to a menstruator in need.  Because everyone deserves to  bfree.             The  b free cup . ÃÂÃÂ© incorporates user-centered design from the ground up, providing a product that is truly designed for all menstruators, regardless of their anatomy or economic position. This is why we offer the most awesome Kickstarter Rewards for a menstrual product we truly believe in.ÃÂÃÂ   And we plan to keep it that way.ÃÂÃÂ   We are going to be listening to you, the girls, women and other  #badassbleeders  who are looking for the most comfortable period ever. Any new reward or stretch goal will reflect what we hear from you.           Risks and challenges  There are inherent risks in every endeavor, but we have taken our time over the last several years to strategize our risk management at every level: From access to raw materials, where we have been developing strong relationships with the most reputable global suppliers of silicone, to the actual manufacturing of the cups, for which we have already built a production process with a local silicone manufacturer here in Canada. We took our time finding the perfect manufacturers for our packaging elements, and once we were satisfied with the samples, found them eager and ready to fulfill our potential orders. While delays in production are always possible, you can rest easy knowing quality control, and a sterile production floor are completely assured. The hardest challenges we face are in overcoming the taboo around the subject of menstruation. A recent, personal and poignant example of this, while creating our creative content, several freelancers who approached us for work, refused the contract outright when they realized how much of the work would center around detailed female anatomy, and period bleeding. While disappointed, we were not discouraged as it lead us to like minded people who were excited about the opportunity of bringing such an ambitious project to life. So, it is in breaking the stigma around periods that we find our greatest challenges, which is perfect because there is nothing we love more than a challenge. Expect perhaps breaking stigmas around menstruation. And chocolate."

Have spent the last 3.5 years developing Lupe and it's debut product the Pure Cordless.,1.0,2019-04-26 10:22:57 -0400,Backed 4 projects,KO,132,"|   Website   |   Instagram   |   Press kit   |  ÃÂÃÂ   Say hello to the Lupe Pure Cordless. ÃÂÃÂ   The world's best performing cordless vacuum.  Designed and built for long-term ownership.   The cordless, fully realised...finally. ÃÂÃÂ        Despite their conception many years ago all cordless vacuum cleaners still donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t deliver on the purity of the original vacuum cleanerÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s design function: to truly clean by delivering powerful suction for a sustained period.  That was, until now.  Introducing the Lupe Pure Cordless vacuum cleaner.ÃÂÃÂ   Designed by industry experts who think differently.  This is the cordless fully realised.ÃÂÃÂ   Finally.       ÃÂÃÂ As seen in:            Before anything else, our product must be an  outstanding vacuum cleaner .ÃÂÃÂ   The Pure Cordless excels at these three major factors where others are compromised.ÃÂÃÂ   Our  patented technology  delivers enduring power that cannot be matched and our unique platform delivers the rest.  The Pure Cordless is a premium machine featuring the latest technology in brushless motors, batteries and dust collection.ÃÂÃÂ   There is no better machine for gathering dust and dirt, and our HEPA filtration captures 99.97% of fine dust and allergens.ÃÂÃÂ              unrivalled suction power through patented technology        Lupe's enduring suction comes from inner  strength .  Our  patented  Suction Intensifier delivers the  strongest  and most  efficient suction  of any cordless out there, with no compromise in picking up any debris type.  See for yourself how we compare to the competition on an exceptional challenge of 20mm (0.8 inches) deep grooves filled with dust :                            How does it work? Unassuming on the outside, you have to look within to find the source of LupeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s enduring power:        Patented Suction Intensifier technology   Optimum pick up across different surfaces and debris types  all  the time, with no settings to change.   1  - Powerful motorised agitator for cleaning hair and deep-down dirt ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093>  great for carpet. ÃÂÃÂ    2  - Air tight rotating seal conforms to all surfaces and debris, preventing unnecessary leaks and increasing suction -  great for hard floors. ÃÂÃÂ    3  - Velocity vane increases air velocity by reducing the opening on the floor surface.  Increased velocity and eliminated leaks results in up to  x10  the useful suction at the cleaner head compared to some conventional designs. ÃÂÃÂ    Doing more with less. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s the power of pure. ÃÂÃÂ         outstanding dust cleaning performance for a full 60 minutes             Power is nothing without  endurance . Unlike other models, the pure cordless offers outstanding dust cleaning performance for a full  60 minutes .ÃÂÃÂ   Put simply, the Pure Cordless cleans significantly more than the competition between charges. ÃÂÃÂ    More cleaning, less charging.ÃÂÃÂ ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s the power of pure.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ          unique format adapts to every cleaning task             The Lupe Pure Cordless is a true  3-in-1  vacuum that offers the best of all worlds wrapped into one convenient package, and has  outstanding reach  to high places  (2m/6.5ft)      the pure cordless has a 2m reach    Conventional cordless stick vacuums put all the weight in your hand, LupeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s unique format makes cleaning high easy with significantly  less weight to lift :     less weight in hand for high reach cleaning    Taking the cleaning head off to switch between configurations is really quick and easy:        Fully capable but smaller in size   We've aimed to bring the whole-house vacuum up to date with the 21st century. The Pure Cordless is slim and convenient but packed with power.        One cleaning head   Rather than multiple cleaning heads, we focused on one head capable of cleaning all surfaces, one that seamlessly moves from one surface to another.  ThereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s no longer any need to have multiple vacuums (or multiple heads) for different tasks.ÃÂÃÂ   Because sometimes, one head really is better than two.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ                   Social and environmental impactÃÂÃÂ    Did you know  50%  of small electrical appliances taken to waste processing in the European Union is from vacuum cleaners? It's pretty shocking.       Especially in cordless vacuums, many companies launch 'new' products year after year which drives perfectly usable, or easily repairable product to waste.  Lupe is different. And the Pure Cordless is different. It is  fully serviceable  and almost every part can be replaced. It has been designed to be as long-lasting as possible: using the  best  components and materials. We are so confident in this we are offering all our Kickstarter backers a special  7 year warranty  (see below for details).  It's been designed to be as  easy to maintain  as possible. We will support  long-term ownership  through open supply of spares and making upgrades available to battery packs and motors as technology moves on.ÃÂÃÂ   You don't throw your whole bicycle away if you want to upgrade a wheel or fit a new tyre - we take that approach to vacuum cleaners. ÃÂÃÂ   We all need great performing products but in an age of huge waste a more conscious effort is required to make essential products last just a little longer.ÃÂÃÂ   Its our founding principle.  See how the Pure Cordless is different:       1- Battery pack removable without tools  2- Brushless motor housed in separate removable housingÃÂÃÂ   3- Washable lifetime filters  4- Single service panel reveals access to motor and control PCB  5- Detachable pickup head has removable components and no PCB electronics on board  6- Dust separation system is self-contained and made from polycarbonate for exceptional durabilityÃÂÃÂ   7- All control electronics centrally housed and re-programmable     the Pure Cordless has been expertly engineered in detail  to ensure the design can stand the test of time    The Pure Cordless will be built in a factory that  pay workers fairly , have high standards of  health  and  safety  and is  ISO14001  certified .  It is committed to conducting business in a manner that delivers continuous improvement in environmental performance and protects the quality of communities where it operates. ÃÂÃÂ   Our chosen factory:   harvests rainwater    collects solar energy    makes use of a ground source system for climate control        We wanted the Pure Cordless to be everything you'd expect of a modern vacuum cleaner, not just a cordless, and we have integrated every feature to the highest possible specification.       ÃÂÃÂ   1- Pickup Head:         The most  energy-efficient  dust pick-up technology available  intensifies  the suction for deep-down cleaning across all surfaces - no settings to change.ÃÂÃÂ   Two motorised agitators deal with any debris type - large, fine and pet hair.ÃÂÃÂ   Easy to remove both brush rollers simply using a coin:         2- Motor:         Our Japanese brushless motor spins at  108,000rpm  (twice as fast as a jet engine) and has exceptional energy efficiency. It's also exceptionally durable.    3- Cyclonic Bagless Separator:         With two stages of cyclonic separation and two stages of filtration the Pure Cordless is at the cutting edge of dust separation technology.  With a genuine  1000cc (1 liter)  capacity the Lupe pure cordless has the one of the largest bin capacities of any cordless. Less bin emptying to get the job done quicker. ÃÂÃÂ   It is also really easy to empty:         4- Battery:         The Pure Cordless 32.4V 81Wh Li-Ion battery delivers  60 minutes  of powerful cleaning from one single charge. The LEDs on the front communicate accurate charge capacity remaining.  The battery can be charged on the machine with no dock, or taken out and charged discretely while the machine is stowed away in a cupboard.  Easy to replace or upgrade in the future:   More cleaning, less charging.ÃÂÃÂ ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s the power of pure.ÃÂÃÂ    The Pure Cordless has  9  Murata (formerly Sony)  high drain, high capacity  lithium-ion cells. The battery pack is fitted with a fully featured protection board to monitor health of the battery and communicate with the control system in the Pure Cordless to always ensure optimum performance.         5- HEPA Anti-Allergy Filter:         A genuine HEPA (H13) filter separating  99.97%  of fine dust and allergens down to  0.3 millionths of a meter . Easy to remove and wash for optimum performance.ÃÂÃÂ   Other brands use lower grade filters that allow 100's of times more fine dust through.ÃÂÃÂ    Accept no substitutes. That's the power of pure.     Accessory Tools:         We've focused on giving you the multi-function accessory tools that are  useful , not a drawer-full that clutters your home and never gets used.ÃÂÃÂ   An upholstery tool and a crevice tool both with slide up/down bristles for dusting.ÃÂÃÂ   The Pure Cordless is supplied with a holder to attach them to the product to save you losing them.    Simple Controls:         The Pure Cordless has very simple controls to access the three power modes and to turn-off/override the brush roller for delicate surfaces.ÃÂÃÂ        The Pure Cordless has been designed and built with two principles at heart -  purity  of purpose, and  longevity  of design.ÃÂÃÂ   WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve designed and built the best possible product with the singular purpose of keeping your home clean, and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve designed it to last: no built-in obsolescence, no superseding product every year. ÃÂÃÂ                       It's not just us that likes the design- we've won an award!       We have spent the last 3.5 years developing the pure cordless to perfection and we are now ready to start production.     3.5 years of evolution of the Lupe pure cordless    Technical SpecsÃÂÃÂ        How we compare to the competition:ÃÂÃÂ             We are offering the first batch of Lupe Cordless on Kickstarter at  big discounts  off the retail price (Retail price will be ÃÂÃÂ± ÃÂÃÂ£460 / USD 599).            What's in the box?ÃÂÃÂ      elegant packaging       packaging ensures the pure cordless arrives in perfect condition (no internal plastic bags)       what's in the box    1- pure cordless main body  2- universal pick-up head with suction intensifier technology  3- lithium ion battery pack  4- charger  (will be territory specific)   5- detachable wand  6- multi-function crevice and upholstery accessory tools and on-board mount       We are offering a special warranty to Kickstarter backers in this campaign.  7 years against defects in material and workmanship.  2 years on the battery pack- this is limited usage habits and is out of our control.ÃÂÃÂ   We think we have the best warranty on the market for a cordless vacuum cleaner with a  Kickstarter specific  7 year warranty on the product (excluding the battery which is 2 years).ÃÂÃÂ    Only our Kickstarter backers will get this 7 year warranty.   If anything comes up, donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t worry because we stand behind our product, just get in touch with us. We will assess the specific problem and decide the quickest way to get your machine back in working order  We designed the Pure Cordless with serviceability in mind. Most major parts can be individually removed and replaced. This not only makes it easier to keep your Pure Cordless in perfect functional condition, it also drastically reduces the amount of waste and unnecessary obsolescence.   How it all startedÃÂÃÂ    Lupe Technology is a Tech startup based in Bristol, UK - a city with a rich engineering history.  Lucas Horne and Pablo Montero founded the company in 2015 with the vision to solve the frustrations they saw consumers were having with cordless vacuum cleaners that were becoming ever more popular but failing to deliver on expectations, both on performance and longevity.       Lucas and Pablo met while working together in the Research and Development department at Dyson. Together we were in charge of a major project to make a vacuum cleaner that was many times better than their other products at the time. We learnt a great deal about what a vacuum cleaner needs to do and what makes it last.ÃÂÃÂ   Following our time at Dyson, we went our separate ways but saw that the problem with cordless vacuumsÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> poor suction and built in obsolescence continued unaddressed.  With a fresh outlook (and a clean sheet of paper) Lupe was founded and the start of a three and a half year journey began. Through many hundreds of prototypes and testing, our team developed the patented Suction Intensifier technology to pick up dust more efficiently, and the unique Lupe Pure Cordless platform to carry it.ÃÂÃÂ      many years worth of testing has gone into the pure cordless       we made use of advance computational modelling techniques to ensure the product will last       prototyping in our workshop       before tooling we trialled parts with vacuum casting techniques           You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

We've reached a critical time when the development is (almost) over and we are ready to launch the product and the brand.ÃÂÃÂ   The Pure Cordless will be rolling off the production line later this year - the end of one part of our journey but an exciting start to the next phase.ÃÂÃÂ              Lucas Horne  (Co-Founder): ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Industrial Designer.

As we progress now from our Research and Development stage into getting our product to market, its very important to us to build a following and get our product known about as much as possible. We see Kickstarter as a great way to do this, and a step towards a full mainstream launch later down the line.ÃÂÃÂ   Securing interest in the product now helps us start production of the first batch of our vacuum cleaners with confidence.ÃÂÃÂ   If successful, the funds will go towards tooling, mass manufacturing of the first batch, certification and shipping logistics. ÃÂÃÂ        This is our production timeline from now until you receive your Lupe Pure Cordless.            Thank you for supporting our campaign and a special thank you to everyone else who has helped us on our journey so far. It would not have been possible without the support of everyone involved - friends, family, investors, advisers and our manufacturing partner. We look forward to the next stage of our journey in delivering the ultimate cordless vacuum ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ               This project is promoted by  Jellop , the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.ÃÂÃÂ                          Risks and challenges  Having worked tirelessly on the pure cordless for three and a half years, we have overcome the primary engineering challenges inherent in a product of this sort. Along the way, we've even secured a patent for our Suction Intensifier technology.  After numerous prototypes and more testing than we care to remember, we're now ready to move to production. We have secured reputable suppliers for key parts such as the motor and battery and have been working with our production partner for the past 18 months on the final design in preparation for manufacturing the Pure Cordless.   We are aware of the challenges posed at this stage and having worked on projects at this level previously we are confident we are up to the task and have in place the necessary steps to minimise risks.   Whilst working hard to deliver as promptly as possible, should delays occur we would be totally up front about them with our community and prioritise clear and concise communication until such a time as the product is shipped."

The project is merging the innovative levitation technology with the form and function of the Cloud product of CloudIX arts Studio. Embedded into both the base and the Cloud are magnetic components that allow the cloud to float approximately 30mm off the base. While the base itself must remain plugged in a 4000mAh rechargeable lithium-ion battery powers (optional) the Cloud and enables a totally wireless and unobstructed levitation while in use. With full rotational movement and slight vertical bobbing of the cloud a more realistic atmospheric experience is possible. The levitating CloudIX also has the sound reactive LED lights as our other Ambient CloudIX products.        Magnetic levitation  or magnetic suspension is a method by which an object is suspended in the air with no support other than invisible magnetic fields. Magnetic force is used to counteract the effects of the gravitational acceleration and any other accelerations.  The two primary issues involved in magnetic levitation are lifting forces: providing an upward force sufficient to counteract gravity, and stability: ensuring that the system does not spontaneously slide or flip into a configuration where the lift is neutralized.

There are two main forms of hanging a light fixture: Swag Kit or Hardwire Kit, both available in black or white.        Swag Option.   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ The Swag option is easier to install, it involves installing a hook (called a Swag hook)ÃÂÃÂ into the ceiling then running the cord along the ceiling to the nearest outlet or extension cord. Instead of the ceiling, it can also be installed onto a beam,ÃÂÃÂ pipe or rig.ÃÂÃÂ This option typically comes with 10ft (3m) of electrical cord, a EU plug (and appropriate adapter for international orders), a switch near the plug end, two hooks and two cord grips /ÃÂÃÂ rings. Please note the hooks that come with your lamp may need appropriate anchors (not included)ÃÂÃÂ depending on the material of your ceiling.   Hardwire Option.   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ This option involves the necessity of a junction box (also known as an electrical box or octagon box) in the location in which the lamp is going and a local electrician to do the installation. If you are replacing an existing pendant or planning to use our designs in a new building or renovation this option may be prefered as it can give a cleaner look than the Swag option. This option typically comes with 6ft (2m) of electrical cord,ÃÂÃÂ a 5"" canopy,ÃÂÃÂ mounting kit, exposed wires, cord grip and wire nuts. Please note that RGB Clouds have external power converters which can be hardwired into or next to your junction box.

We have researched instinct of animals and found out that animals use all five senses to hunt. We finally come up with the first bleeding bait stimulating fishÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> senses. The first B-Bait, Cthulhu.",1.0,2019-05-08 21:17:36 -0400,Backed 0 projects,"Linwood, Fort Lee, NJ",2,"One day we saw a group of fishes that were targeting and attacking an injured fish. That gave us the question of whether animals have the instinct to attack the weakest by nature?       A series of documentary films gave us the answer to our question.       We applied this idea on fishes and started to do some research about their habits and instincts by reading various academic articles and resources. ÃÂÃÂ        If there is such a thing as a bleeding fish under water, it could stimulates the instincts of the fish to attack and seize their prey. When it smells similar of its favorite prey, the fish will get attracted to it which makes fishing more fun.  That is why we called our baits B-Bait (bleeding bait).            B-Bait is a bait that is inspired by the habits of the fish. The smell of pheromone or prey comes from the B-Bait, while it trembles and bleeds as soon as it touches the water            It is well-known fact that sharks can detect the smell of its prey from miles away. We got motives of a shark to create a bait and a capsule.            ÃÂÃÂ How we embody the habit of fish to a bait? There are baits covered by pheromone on their surface that last not long enough. The secret of long lasting performance of B-Bait is the capsule.ÃÂÃÂ             Fizzy effect is applied to B-Bait. We have developed different capsules in different flavours with pheromones. As soon as the capsule hits the water, the fizzy effect with bleeding effect occurs and spreads odors of pheromone and tastes. In this way B-Bait stimulates the instinct of the fish       Fizzy effect takes place differently depending on the temperature. We had an experiment for bass in two different temperatures.ÃÂÃÂ        We compared the speed of fizzy effects in two different temperatures based on the lowest and the highest of the season when bass is active            Between 55F and 73F, the capsules last between 13 and 20 minutes, average 15 minutes. For a better result, we will keep improving the performance of the capsule                We have prepared shrimp and bait fish capsules. We did our best to make it similar to their preys. These are common tastes for the fish from the freshwater and the sea.  For Kick starter, we have prepared shrimp and bait fish capsules. The worm capsules will only be included in a special package. If you want all three capsules, please choose the special package.ÃÂÃÂ        We are going to developing other flavours. Flavors of lobster, shellfish, and pupa have been researched targeting for specific species. Please keep your eyes on us and encourage us even after Kick starter.ÃÂÃÂ                   The main materials of the capsule are Pheromones, which stimulate the instincts of fish and powders of real fish.We used different powders and materials based on target species. For the bleeding performance, we used red-beet for color. We have researched and developed to apply the instinct of fish into bait, but also we have considered environment not to contaminate the nature, but to have an amazing performance.ÃÂÃÂ   The first lure that B-bait capsule system applied, Cthulhu.ÃÂÃÂ                    There have been baits to stimulate the smell of fish, but most of them were covered by smell just on their surface by spraying or putting them in the liquid for a certain time. Unfortunately, there is a limitation that the smell does not last long enough after one or two time tries. We have strived to extend the time of smell. After we apply all the technology to B-bait, we finally made the first model of B-bait, Cthulhu                    When you put B-Bait capsule into Cthulhu lure and put them into the water, it starts to fizzy like a bleeding and dying prey under the water. By doing so, this attracts fish.ÃÂÃÂ        You will see an amazing performance when Cthulhu with B-Bait capsule hits the water. As the image shows, there is an empty space in Cthulhu for B-Bait capsule and a hole where blood comes out.ÃÂÃÂ        On the front of B-Bait, we put salt so that anglers can through further.ÃÂÃÂ   See details below ÃÂÃÂ             When Cthulhu moves under the water, smells and colors spread. This will bring fish around Cthulhu. This looks simple, but there are various scientific technology applied that you have never seen in the market. More improved B-Bait will keep coming out. ÃÂÃÂ        If you cast Cthulhu with B-Bait capsule and then move it under the water, you will see rigorous competition among fish. Imagine a bleeding bait under the water. IsnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t it fun?ÃÂÃÂ                         B-Bait Cthulhu contains salt. The salt plays an important role in increasing the weight of lure. The weight and quantity of salt in Cthulhu is set scientifically. The back side of Cthulhu is relatively lighter due to the less salt compared to the front side. The heavier front side allows anglers to cast further.ÃÂÃÂ        The heavy front side makes anglers to cast further. This also helps for more accurate casting.ÃÂÃÂ        Difference in weights of the front and back side also allows anglers to make a distinct action. Anglers control Cthulhu as dead prey or an octopus fuming ink and running away from its enemy. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ             You can use more diverse fishing techniques with B-Bait                      We produce Cthulhu in different colors. It is well-known fact that fish is sensitive to colors. According to different situations for fishing and targeted fish species, you can choose the color that you need. We prepared the most popular colors such as pumpkin green or water melon, but also such as pink and white.           We have considered to find the easiest way for the users to put the capsule in Cthulhu. It needed a number of tests and failures. We ended up creating a stick to put the capsule more easily.ÃÂÃÂ          The end of B-Bait stick is designed easily to put the B-Bait capsule in Cthulhu. You will enjoy it while putting them together manually. The stick is designed not to slip away from your hand, so B-bait sick will always be with you!            ÃÂÃÂ This little and cute B-Bait stick would bring you a joy when you put B-Bait capsule into the Cthulhu. The stick makes it way easier to put the capsule into the Cthulhu. According to the situation, you can insert maximum 7 capsules into the Cthulhu. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ After putting B-Bait capsule into the Cthulhu, you connect a needle to the Cthulhu. We recommend the WIDE GAP HOOK 4/0~5/0 size as an optimized size.              B-Bait stick is designed and manufactured by 3D printing to customize for the B-Bait. ÃÂÃÂ                                         To launch a project on Kickstarter, we need to check the response from the market and do marketing beforehand. We started to get in contact with powerful and creative influencers around the world who loves fishing and sended them handwritten letters and gift boxes.                                People responded more than we expected. Especially, the influencers who actually received and tested B-Bait gave us a comment that B-Bait will be ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0098>a game changerÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>.

What Is Active Compression?  Active leg compression is a form of compression that  mimics natural muscle contractions  in your calves. It helps  improve circulation, increase cellular oxygen supply, and stimulate tissue repair.         Active Compression helps:        By compressing your legs, you  encourage circulation of blood  where it needs the most support. This, in turn, can help reduce swelling and usher in fresh blood, nutrients, and lymphatic fluid to your legs to help accelerate healing and recovery.       Supporting Circulation In Your Legs            Due to gravity,  your legs usually have the worst circulation in your body -  especially if youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re standing or sitting all day . Without active circulation through your calves, blood will pool at your feet - resulting in swelling and pain.  When your muscle pump  remains inactive , you  risk blood pooling,  and  inhibit circulation throughout your body   (the blood in your feet is the same blood that is circulated through your heart and to your brain) .       This is why we  focus on actively compressing your legs  to help  get that blood moving!   The Benefits of Improved Circulation  Active Compression is an effective way to  improve circulation ,  flush lactic acid , and  increase oxygenation  to muscle tissues to get you back on your feet faster.  Get more oxygen  throughout your body and  higher performance .   Improved Circulation can help:        Passive Compression Just DoesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t Cut It  YouÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve likely encountered other compression tools such as socks, wraps, and sleeves.  The main issue with these passive compression accessories is that  they donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t do much  when youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re  in an office, plane, car, kitchen  -  anywhere youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be sitting or standing.        Passive compression only provides support when you are using your muscle pump. In other words, they  only work when youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re ALREADY active  - in a workout or on a walk/run.       This is where Active Compression comes in.   Active Compression actively MIMICS the action of the calf muscle pump  without you needing to do anything!   The Beauty of Active Compression        The Problem With Other Devices  Current devices are  ineffective  or  only accessible to professional athletes.  These devices end up being  bulky,  covered in wires and hoses,  not portable , and  extremely expensive.        They can haveÃÂÃÂ  poor compression patterns ÃÂÃÂ that donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t use active compression, donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t match the muscle pump, or, worse,ÃÂÃÂ  do more harm than good  by pushing blood  in the wrong direction.    Bulky - complicated, heavy, not portable    Expensive - reserved for high-paying professional athletes    Poor Compression Pattern - dangerous and harmful        The Power of SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢  Using our  patent-pending WaveTech compression pattern,  SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ effectively mimics your skeletal muscle pump - which means it is  the best way to help enhance your bodyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s natural circulatory flow.        This means you  get safe, powerful, and effective active compression  that compliments your bodyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s natural rhythm.ÃÂÃÂ    No reverse flow  (which can get dangerous) - SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ makes sure your blood goes where it needs to go, the way itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s supposed to go,  faster and more effectively .       Patent-Pending WaveTech Pattern  Our unique  patent-pending compression patterns  actively and gently push your blood in the right direction and  work with the natural flow of your body.          ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ They do this by  mimicking the skeletal muscle pump  that acts as a second heart - aiding the return of blood to your core to help reduce swelling and muscle injury.       YouÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll  feel your blood circulating  through your calves, up your thighs, and through your body fluidly and powerfully. Relax as your body  enters accelerated flow.   Strategic Pneumatic Pressure  We compartmentalized the compression areas to  three strategic parts of your calf  to make sure we help maximize blood flow and the efficacy of the compression.        Feel the powerful massage  hit just  the right spots.   Targeted Compression Affects Your Whole Leg        Not just for your calves!  Improving circulation at the lower extremities  naturally helps push blood upwards through your thighs towards the heart . As a result, the lower extremities of your legs are one of the best targets to help improve blood circulation.  Synchronized Compression  SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t just  synced with your naturally occurring muscle pump and blood circulation , it  syncs with its adjoining pair automatically.        Through the use of Infrared technology, each SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ device connects and syncs with its pair to give you  dual active compression.        The patterns in each leg will be  synced up and matched,  so you have a  cohesive and comfortable  session  in complete harmony.ÃÂÃÂ         3 Levels Of Intensity       Simply press the intensity button to increase or decrease the level of compression intensity you want.       Internal sensors ensure SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ never pushes beyond your comfort, so you know youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re in good hands!        Choose between two powerful compression patterns:        3 Steps To Setup                      Untethered Performance       SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ is  completely wireless and tubeless . You can use it in whatever position and any situation. Simply strap it on and let it run! ThereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s nothing to plug in or connect -  a fully untethered experience.   Compact &amp; Portable  Not only is SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ wireless, itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s also  small and compact . You can easily fit it in your bag and even  use it on a plane.        Through its unique design and patent-pending compression pattern, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll get  improved circulation throughout your entire leg  with  just a small area of compression . The device only wraps around your ankle and calves, so you can  remain totally mobile  without clunkiness or constraint.  Feels Amazing       Did we mention? SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢  feels absolutely incredible!  We honestly canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t talk about it enough. The pneumatic compression is like a a  deep tissue leg massage  that helps  circulate your blood, pull out pain,  and  relax your entire body.    Check out what users had to say about it!        Long-Lasting Battery  SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ has a powerful battery that can give up to  2.5 hours of active use . That means you can have  up to 10 sessions  before needing a recharge.       The device can be  easily recharged via micro-usb cable .  One Size Fits Most  Whether you have large legs or tiny calves, SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ has you in mind. We used a  one-size-fits-most  model using velcro straps to attach the device.            The straps are  fully adjustable , so you can switch sizes quickly and easily.  Machine-Washable  Sweaty legs? Not a problem! The inner layer of SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ can be removed and is  100% machine washable.         Sustainable &amp; Affordable   Pneumatic active compression used to be  reserved only   for professional athletes , universities, and the uber-rich. Now, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re bringing its  performance enhancing powers  to you  for a tenth of the cost (thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s 90% off)!        YouÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll not just be getting the same effects, but youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll have it  better, faster,  and  much more portable  than the rest.       Throughout this process, we were heavily influenced and inspired by video games. We loved the artwork, design, and mechanics found in these fictional, digital worlds and wanted to  create a regeneration tool like those seen in games.    With SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢, we believe we got pretty close.ÃÂÃÂ         Naturally, we felt our outer layer skin designs should reflect this achievement. So we designed our outer skins to have  four unique colorways  that  draw homage to our favorite video game experiences.ÃÂÃÂ    SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ is your  real-life power boost  and  looks it too!             SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t just for athletes! If you stand or sit a lot, you need to get blood circulating to  stay healthy, relieve tired and achy legs , and help  increase cognitive performance!  This means Spryng is perfect for everyone!       From DJs to Moms to CEOs and gamers,  get higher level performance across all areas of life! ÃÂÃÂ                            We want our backers to have a great experience with SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢. We are doing everything in our power - from sourcing the best quality materials to rigorous quality control processes - to ensure that we would get the best product into the hands of our backers. As we are just starting up and offering SPRYNGÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ at highly discounted prices on Kickstarter, we are only able to accept returns due to manufacturing defect.                                     Several years ago our team was focused on looking at one significant leg condition ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> diabetic neuropathy. When we dug deep into the realms of neuropathy we realized that a method called active compression could be a wonderful solution to this. That took us down the route of looking at active compression and the technologies we could use to achieve this.ÃÂÃÂ   In our journey, the more we researched, the more we realized that active compression could not only offer a potential solution for diabetic neuropathy, but it had far more expansive potential therapeutic effects. It was something that could benefit tens of millions of people all over the world.ÃÂÃÂ   Sadly, a lot of the active compression solutions that were out there were either very very expensive or were used in hospital settings that were inaccessible for many people. We wanted to do it differently. We wanted to bring active compression to everyone out there. Hence, we created Spryng!ÃÂÃÂ   Through Spryng, we want to bring the benefits of active compression in an easy to use and affordable manifestation to all of you!ÃÂÃÂ          This project is promoted by  Jellop , the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.ÃÂÃÂ                                        Risks and challenges  We have worked extremely hard to prepare this product for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what we see as the risks and our plan to assess them:  MANUFACTURING: The manufacturer is lined up, and we have quality assurance people on site during production.  FULFILLMENT: Sometimes things get a bit crazy and stuff happens that canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, customs clearance or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. We are using an experienced logistics team to get our products to you. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll keep open and honest communication with you throughout our process so you know where your product is and when itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s going to get to you."

After sucessfully launching RetroStone on Kickstarter last year, 8BCraft is proud to present you the revised Metal version of RetroStone! (Note that this is not RetroStone2!)            So this is basically a revision of the RetroStone on which all the hardware issues that we encountered on first production have been solved. System is now stable and optimized to reduce defect rate. And of course with a really dashing aluminium CNC case which gives an incredible feel!       ÃÂÃÂ CNC case means that each case is made individually out of a block of aluminium. A machine drills the block until it gives the RetroStone shape! Then the case are ionidized to prevent corrosion. The process is long, making the production cost very high, specially compared to injection molding cases.       More pictures at the end of the campaign!  But first, for those who don't know yet RetroStone, here is some more details !ÃÂÃÂ        RetroStone is a mini computer running an emulation station OS (built on linux).  You can use it to play to over 50 old video game systems : ÃÂÃÂ Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, Super Nintendo, Megadrive/Genesis, Atari, MaMe and so on. You can have a look  here  to all the supported systems.ÃÂÃÂ   In more technical terms it is basically a SbC (single board computers) with all the peripheral needed to make a handheld console (screen, speaker, battery...). Making it perfect to run Emulation Station/Retropie.  So yes, all your childhood video games on one handheld console, that you can plug to your TV, and play multiplayer. Yes that's a high five to my-10-years-old-self!       But wait! You are saying that we can play any game of our childhood, what does it mean exactly? Does RetroStone comes with games integrated?ÃÂÃÂ    Software  : Retrostone is compatible with Retrorangepi (Retropie distribution for Armbian). Retropie is anÃÂÃÂ awesome emulation station software (super easy installation, it will be explained step-by-step in the tutorial!).ÃÂÃÂ You can check them on Youtube for demo ! Those softwares come with a wide range of systems supported : Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, Super Nintendo, Megadrive/Genesis, Atari, MaMe and so on. You can have a look  here  to all the supported systems.  RetroStone is also compatible with most other H3 SBC OS (Armbian, Android...).   Games  : To install a game you need it's ROM file. A ROM file is a computer file containing all the game's data. You can legally download ROM of unlicensed games on the internet.ÃÂÃÂ   Some homebrew games of which makers agreed to have their games integrated into Retrorangepi :     Retroid, Run to Databay, Rope and Bombs, Into the Blue       The Legend of Owlia, ÃÂÃÂµCity, Nomoles    For licensed games legality of downloading ROM depend on your country. In some you need to have original copy of the game. In some others it may not be legal at all to download ROMs from internet.  Then to install the ROM you can transfer it with a USB stick to RetroStone.   Develop your own game, share them and discover other RetroStone user's games !ÃÂÃÂ    I think there's a lot of potential to develop and share your games! There's a topic on the 8BCraft forum dedicated to this. Let's make it more alive! :)       HDMI output : you can connect RetroStone to your big TV !ÃÂÃÂ        4 USB connectors!       Play up to 5 players !       Take RetroStone everywhere with it's compact form factor! No more boring flights for you!       Audio control       Gamepad controls:                 MicroSD easy access. Standard 5V micro-USB charger.       Inside you have a RetroStone Pi, this SBC (single board computer) runs a  H3 processor  which is  4 cores 1.2GHz .ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ             ÃÂÃÂ Note : the energysquare pins are not supported, as case is metal it shortcuts the power. So if you upgrade you will have to remove the pins (remove them manually).       Basic RetroStone will come with 16GB SD card, which can already hold thousands of games.   Upgrade from 16GB to 32GB memory for FREE  by sharing RetroStone kickstarter on facebook!  Copy the URL of your facebook post and save it for later. At the end of the Kickstarter I will send you a survey for shipping details, there you will be able to put your URL to get the free memory card upgrade!            Joining me on kickstarter is not only about getting a nice game console. It's also about the journey of the project! As you can check on my first Kickstarter campaign RaspiboyÃÂÃÂ I made a point to give good updates (check for yourself  HERE ). With interesting facts on production.ÃÂÃÂ   Here are exemples of what people thought of them!            The main advantages of RetroStone compared with Raspiboy are :ÃÂÃÂ   - Easy memory card access  - Assembled and fully tested  - Compact form factor  - More powerful CPU  - Ethernet, more USB connectors and full size HDMI       ÃÂÃÂ Size comparaison of RetroStone and RaspiboyÃÂÃÂ             ÃÂÃÂ By connecting a screen, keyboard and mouse, your console becomes the perfect living room computer. Write a novel, surf YouTube or watch your movies on your big screen while kicking back on your couch.ÃÂÃÂ                       ÃÂÃÂ Makers I have not forgotten you! RetroStone may come assembled but we left room for customization!  RetroStone has 26 GPIO available, with built-in pull up resistors            2 of those GPIO have optional buttons built-in the RetroStone Pi if you want to add C and Z buttons. Also as the cases will be CNC you will be able to choose if you want the case drilled for additional buttons or not.     Note: on picture there are 4 optional buttons, but the 2 on left side have been removed.         That's something I often hear. Lot of kickstarter project are scams and never deliver their promised product. But that is because lot of them are selling ideas that are not ready to industrialize. Sometime you can even see their pictures are just 3D modeling, meaning they don't even have prototypes. Or they can have prototypes that are not ready for industrialized production.ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ As my 2 first Kickstarter campaigns can attest I am as transparant as I can be, my prototypes are really ready for production. And I did delivered all my backers!  Please check my website to see to see for yourself :  www.8BCraft.com   ÃÂÃÂ Also on Youtube you can find lot of reviews of  RetroStones  and  Raspiboys , showing you they do exist for real :)       ÃÂÃÂ It can be : ÃÂÃÂ    For yourself to have some good fun with friends. ÃÂÃÂ     To make a gift to a special someone.ÃÂÃÂ     To discover the world of hackerspaces, fablabs and SBC (single board computers).        90ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ : RetroStone Aluminium CNC case - EARLY BIRDS  100ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ : RetroStone Aluminium CNC case - Kickstarter price  215ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ : RetroStone Metal Edition - EARLY BIRDS  230ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ : RetroStone Metal Edition - Kickstarter price  430ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ : 2 RetroStone Metal Edition  1000ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ : 5 RetroStone Metal Edition       PCB of RetroStone pi are already in stock. So it only needs to make the CNC cases, assemble, test and ship the units!  That should take about 2 months.                                                                                                                         Risks and challenges  The aluminium CNC factory have relatively high MOQ and the metal cases are very expensive to manufacture. This is why the metal edition is more expensive than normal RetroStone. For this reason we must reach a reasonable amount of pre-order to be able to order the metal cases!"

John Wayd is a geeky project for runner and  running lovers . It is  totally free . It's not an app but a chatbot accessible via Facebook, Telegram, Kik, Email, texting, Skype or WeChat.ÃÂÃÂ   You just have to chat with John and get in contact with runners around you. This chatting robot currently organizes runs around your place and find people willing to run with you.ÃÂÃÂ   It's live and free.ÃÂÃÂ   On top, it's collaborative i.e. anyone can edit the very simple open-source script to make it better.  ÃÂÃÂ Give us one dollar or more. It will make a difference.       2) Try Now!  Chat with John now.  Facebook: http://m.me/JohnWaydBot   Telegram:  https://telegram.me/  JohnWaydBot   Kik: https://kik.me/John.Wayd   Line, Skype, Wechat, SMS, iMessage:TBD soon  But also improve the script if you are an authorized contributor here:  https://github.com/regiscop/JohnWayd   3) Why we need you?  There are obviously some server cost (AWS bills) that needs to be paid to make this project a success.ÃÂÃÂ Indeed, we want to keep this project  free, independent and open-source .  We also need a development for the :   Automatic Testing of the code after a change in the script,    Automatic deployment after a change in the script (change that can be done by any backers),ÃÂÃÂ     Improvement of the product (the script of John Wayd).   This is why we need  YOU .  On top of this, the script is DESIGNED TO BE VERY SIMPLE and publicly editable by backers. It's OPEN TO COLLABORATION. Contributors can edit the script and, if the test passes, the new script will  automatically change the chats of all users . Feel free to contribute and/or modify the script.  The code is pushed in production automatically based on the files stored on an open-source GitHub repository.  The current challenges are on the automation of the script testing (after any pull request made on GitHub).  As anyone can edit the script of the chatbot (on GitHub), some part of the code written by contributors will have to be challenged by other contributors like any  Wikipedia  pages for example before it's putted in production. We count on the community to collaborate and improve the skills of the chatbot. Nevertheless, the smooth push of the new version of script cannot be done without any sanity checks. This will be an important challenge.  Note: The scalability of the project is not an issue. More users will just increase the cost of the AWS bills.  4) Who are we?  We are just 2 friends from the University. We have full time jobs during the day. We also like running together and coding. We dreamed about a platform organizing group-runs. So we did a python code that is running a open-sourced script. As simple as this.ÃÂÃÂ   If you think this is a cool story, share this project on Facebook:                                                       Risks and challenges  The current challenges are on the automation of the script testing."

How is it different from other Online Courses?  We strive to provide world-class AI education at reasonable prices. To achieve that, we have put in a lot of planning and efforts to provide a rich learning experience for the students. Here are the important factors which make these courses different:   1. The Best Curriculum   The series of courses by OpenCV.org will have the best and the most comprehensive curriculum for learning Computer Vision. Here's why --    Designed by industry experts : These courses are designed by a team of engineers and researchers currently working in the computer vision and machine learning industry. We are bringing all our knowledge and experience to these courses.     Both C++ and Python versions (exclusive Kickstarter offe r): You will get access to both the C++ and Python versions of the first two courses at no additional charge.     Comprehensive &amp; practical:  Computer vision and machine learning is vast. These courses, along with our future courses, will be the most comprehensive study material in computer vision available online.     A balance between theory and practice:  When we surveyed available courses in AI, we found two kinds of courses ---  1)  Academic and theoretically deep courses that are meant for students pursuing a Ph.D. but do not teach you how to use practical tools and libraries.  2)  Theoretically shallow courses that teach you how to use libraries without explaining the underlying algorithms.  In our material, you will develop a solid theoretical foundation that will help you understand algorithms and debug problems. However, we will not indulge in unnecessary mathematical details that are only of academic interest. ÃÂÃÂ     2. Course Forums   Learning anything new is difficult.ÃÂÃÂ   Every once in a while your progress stalls because you are stuck in one little thing --- a library does not install, a piece of code dies without warning, or you cannot figure out the right parameters to make an algorithm work.ÃÂÃÂ   This is where a little help can make a huge difference. At a gym you can safely go beyond your current limits while bench pressing if you have a spotter. Even elite athletes have coaches because a little help goes a long way.ÃÂÃÂ    We will support our students in our course forums. You read it right -- our instructors will help you out if you are stuck. ÃÂÃÂ    You will also get to interact with your peers in the course forums, and who knows you may find a future collaborator to work with.ÃÂÃÂ    3. Projects, Assignments, and Case Studies   Our courses are designed around curated projects where we build real-world applications. The lectures cover all the theory necessary to build the projects.ÃÂÃÂ   Resumes are old fashioned. In today's competitive job market you need to demonstrate skills using a portfolio of projects.ÃÂÃÂ   These projects are great demos to show off your skills in front of an interviewer evaluating your application for a job.ÃÂÃÂ   Every course has coding assignments that test what you have learned.  Online labs  with hosted notebooks ensure you can try out the code while you are going through the material.  Finally, in every course we go over case studies covering a research paper.ÃÂÃÂ    4. Graduate proudly   Our primary goal is to ensure you have a rock solid foundation in computer vision because with knowledge and experience comes the confidence to take on real-world problems.  At the same time it is also our goal to make sure your resume looks great and you are seen favorably by recruiters.ÃÂÃÂ    A strong portfolio with real-world projects  will help you stand out in a competitive job market.  On successful completion of a course, you will receive a  digital certificate from OpenCV.org  that you can proudly display on LinkedIn.  5. Exclusive Kickstarter Offers  There are many benefits that are available  exclusively for our Kickstarter supporters  and will not be available once the campaign ends. These are:    Heavy discounts on all the courses and bundles.      12 months for completing the projects and getting the certification. It will be 6 months afterwards.ÃÂÃÂ       Access to both C++ and Python version of the first 2 courses without any additional cost.      An option to buy all future courses at a fixed price.

It is designed for any home, and even your boat and RV!  How does it work?ÃÂÃÂ   - Evaporation rate of water is factored by temperature, pressure, surface area and so on...  - To increase the evaporation rate of water, Morus Zero not just uses heat, but also lower the air pressure inside the dryer.ÃÂÃÂ      We found that over 50% of tumble dryer users were not satisfied with the drying performance such as dryness and drying time, while more than 40% complained about high energy consumption.     Standard home tumble dryers just take too long to dry even the smallest of wash loads. They take up too much home space and can rack up a fortune in energy bills and even damage fabrics, but with Morus Zero, all of those are a thing of the past.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ                                       ÃÂÃÂ  Dry as well as fresh ÃÂÃÂ    The built-in UV sterilization effectively eliminates 99.9% of bacteria during the ultrafast drying time. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s also environmentally friendly since there are no dangerous or toxic chemicals to handle. So not only does Morus Zero keep your clothes dry, but also keeps them clean from any nasty bacteria!         Drying clothes just got smarter    The moisture sensor system automatically turns off the device when Morus Zero can no longer detect moisture within the clothes and the drying is finished. Just press ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>StartÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ, sit back, relax and let Morus Zero do the rest. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s that simple.ÃÂÃÂ          Say goodbye to wrinkles    Unlike the single-motor design of other conventional dryers, Morus Zero has three high-performance motors inside, one of which is used to drive the drum to rotate independently. Our program can precisely control the direction, speed and even acceleration of the tumble. In this way the clothes can be dried evenly and come out with fewer wrinkles.ÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ  Plug in and go ÃÂÃÂ    The compact design of the Morus Zero makes it an ideal choice for small living spaces, like starter homes, cramped city apartments and even RVs. Basically, you can place it anywhere. It is convenient to install, and there is no pipe setup, making it easy to get started with the Morus Zero right away. ÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ  More emojis are on their way ^_&lt; ÃÂÃÂ    Easily select the drying mode you like. Its clear display will show you all the information you want to know.ÃÂÃÂ          Mold problem? No problem!    Its design effectively prevents mold growth in your home. Instead of disposing all the water into the air by ventilation, the detachable water tank collects and stores most of the moisture evaporating from the clothes, and the built-in water level sensor notifies when the tank needs to be emptied.       Morus combines a sleek minimalist design with patented Vacuum+ÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ dehydration technology changing the way you dry your clothes &amp; giving you more time to enjoy what you do best. Thanks to Vacuum+ÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ dehydration technology, ultraviolet light and infrared heating, Morus Zero takes your drying experience to a new level.ÃÂÃÂ                Morus BLDC motor provides 20% more power with an even smaller size!    Morus Zero uses a custom-built, high-performance Neodymium magnet brushless motor to drive a pump to create a low-pressure environment which allows water to evaporate at a higher speed.     Its 3.3lb capacity is perfect for your daily change outfits.     Just let Morus Zero keep your clothes dry and fresh everyday!ÃÂÃÂ                                  While at CES we met some very friendly faces that stopped in awe and wonder by our stall to see the Morus Zero tumble dryer. During the 4 days at CES in Las Vegas, we were more than happy with the reception and received a lot of great feedback from attendees.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ                                                 We made two tests on 4 identical L-size long sleeve shirts (three shirts in the first and one shirt in the other)after spin-dry by washing machine. The remaining moisture content of the shirts is 30%-33%.          Morus Zero has two color options - Chalk White and Lava Gray. You can select the color you like in our post-campaign survey later.      Stretch Goal         A set of premium wool dryer balls and a foldable laundry basket will be sent for FREE with each product to our backers. Let's look forward to our next unlocked stretch goal!                      Founding Team       We are a startup team located in Shenzhen, invested and mentored by Xbotpark and Brizan Capital. With an endless passion for innovation, equipped with years of R&amp;D and production experience in the drone and medical care fields, we are committed to promoting the automation and intelligence of household work, using advanced automation control tools from robotics and related industries to cut steps and reduce the wait time of everyday housework, truly making life happier.

We are funded on the night of May 16th and it's time to release our first stretch goal: an 'Explorer Kit' containing everything you need to get started with molecular biology!!!      Feles Explorer Kit:  ÃÂÃÂ      Rendering of what the Explorer Kit will look like (contents may change during development).    The Feles Explorer kit will include all the reagents you need to get started with learning and understanding synthetic biology. ÃÂÃÂ What is synthetic biology you ask? Synthetic biology is the field where we combine what we understand about biology with engineering and logic principles to create new things. With your help, we will perform all the internal testing and ensure that the Explorer kit is available online when you receive your Feles One so you can get started exploring right away.  In the explorer kit, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll find everything you need to perform your own PCR (polymerase chain reaction), to stitch DNA together, and to transfer the DNA into cells. The newly ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>transformedÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ cells will then obtain new function, such as produce a new color pigment they werenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t able to produce before!  Each kit will come with all of the reagents you would need to do these experiments several times to ensure understanding. Feles will perform extensive internal testing to ensure that the reagents or biological products used are safe and not harmful to the environment.ÃÂÃÂ        We are in the middle of a global biotech revolution that is only accessible to a very small slice of the public. Not only is hardware for doing bio stuck in the same state as computer mainframes of the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0098>60s, the software and documentation are either scattered or written in professional jargon.ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ At Feles (pronounced ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0098>fee-lesÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>), we believe that the ability to explore biology belongs to everyone, and that together, we can make breakthroughs that will shape the world of tomorrow. To do so, we are redesigning the laboratory tools, the software controls, as well as the learning experience all at once to deliver a modern, integrated experience. From the very beginning, we knew it was going to be a crazy journey. However, by combining our team's diverse expertise, countless sleepless nights, and lots of advice and encouragement from family and friends, here we are with our first product, the Feles Lab. We need your help to take this revolution to the next stage.

Learning is about experiencing with our hands and perceptions; learning is not only accepting what it is, but also dreaming about possibilities and inventing alternatives. ÃÂÃÂ However, Not much has changed in how we teach biology in the past 50 years -- the focus has mostly been on delivering facts rather than elements that spark curiosity. In addition, ÃÂÃÂ not all students and schools have access to expensive laboratory equipment, and standard labs take up a lot of space that schools canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t afford. ÃÂÃÂ So the time is ripe for disruption in this space. We want to bring the bio lab access to more students. With the compact Feles One, you can convert a normal classroom or a chemical lab into a bio lab for an engaging learning experience. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Student can go beyond memorizing the basics of DNA to actually visualizing it on a gel and doing their own DNA engineering.

Please send contact us at curriculum@felesbio.com       In collaboration with MANTA Product Development, we performed ergonomic and usability testing to come up with an integrated system that is not only easy to use, but also easy to clean and carry. We even found room for a storage compartment for your reagents.ÃÂÃÂ             Safety is always our top priority. ÃÂÃÂ We are doing our best to make sure the product is safe to use. But once they are out, it needs your attention to carefully follow the safety rules. As the community grow, we will keep updating the safety guidelines.   Do :   Wear gloves during experiments and wash your hands thoroughly before and after experiments    Spray the Feles Lab with the provided alcohol cleaner and wipe it down with a paper towel after each experiment    Follow local and national guidelines when disposing of your experimental waste materialsÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ  DonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t:    Cultivate known or potentially disease causing bacteria or viruses    Dispose of biological material in the sink or trash without first sterilizing them using bleach or alternative cleansers    Let nutrient rich media and agar set on the Feles Lab or other surfaces sit without cleaning them up    never intentionally create or distribute organisms which can self replicate and spread its genes into the natural population.ÃÂÃÂ               ÃÂÃÂ If you want to get a Feles lab as early as this Christmas, ÃÂÃÂ back us on Kickstarter today.

All the profits will go to the creator of the application.ÃÂÃÂ    Application fundamentals:ÃÂÃÂ    While the Feles Lab represent a fairly complete set of laboratory tools, we recognize that it doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t cover everything. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s okay if your application require access to additional equipment, simply let us know and we will evaluate if we can include the additional equipment as a part of the application package as an add-on.  The Feles Lab is limited to a maximum power draw of  280W  by the power supply and software locked to allow no more than two modules to run simultaneously. This can be changed by editing the operating system of the Feles Box, whose control board is accessible by unscrewing the face plate at the four corners, and carefully lifting it up to expose the IO board of the nanoPC mounted to the back of the touchpad.  By default, every module is controlled by its own app in its own linux process  Please follow both local and board biosafety guidelines when thinking about your development plan. As a general rule of thumb, applications should be limited to  biosafety level 1 (BSL1).ÃÂÃÂ            A few snapshots of our prototyping process       Bird's eye view of all of the components       Sometimes it took three people to figure out the wiring :)       Testing how the housing main looks propped up on a floating style base       Making sure everything fit       This was taken right after we finished the 1st assembly. Everyone said ""WOW""         Mass production is never easy.ÃÂÃÂ But we have a few advantages. Instead of contacting manufacturers only after we were done prototyping, we started the initial development on the manufacturing floor in Shenzhen and directly sourced our hardware parts from volume vendors. Finally, we designed our hardware and assembly strategy with volume production in mind. ÃÂÃÂ   With established manufacturing partnerships in China, we secured OEM partners and we are familiar with the remaining steps toward the mass production. Finally, to ensure you receive the perfect Feles One biolab, we will put it through the most rigorous quality control and functionality tests.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ      Our manufacturing partner (top); from sketch to machined aluminum (bottom)          Where we are right now:   Concept done! Electrical Engineer done! ÃÂÃÂ Mechanical Design done! Industrial Design Done! First prototype assembly done! ÃÂÃÂ   The current centrifuge can only spin up to 2,000xg. We would like to continue developing and safety testing the centrifuge up to a speed of 8,000xg. ÃÂÃÂ   Mobile App is still under development. While the UI concept is already done, further development will be a stretch goal of this campaign. The mobile app will serve as a community space for people who are interested in exploring science and experimenting with robust protocols in the field of biology. The main feature is to create and share professional level biology protocols to a broader audience.

We would like to thank early explorers and pioneers such as Bento Lab and Chaibio for their contribution in DIYbio community.ÃÂÃÂ            Risks and challenges  WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re a small team of young and energetic people with a wide array of expertise from biology, industrial design, UI/UX design, and manufacturing. We are also very fortunate to have a large network of collaborators who we can call upon whenever challenges arise. As complex of a project as building the Feles One prototype was, our team has risen to meet the challenges every step of the way. It is our promise to you that we will meet all future challenges with the same attitude, and do everything in our power to look after you, our very first backers and supporters, by shipping the pledge rewards on-time.  As noted earlier, our current centrifuge is rated for only 2,000xg while the motor is capable of a much higher 8,000xg. This is because we are still in the process of safety testing our centrifuge enclosure to ensure that it can capture any shrapnel produced should anything go wrong at high speeds. In the event that significant resigns are required in order to safely achieve 8,000xg, we will ship the Feles One with a 2,000xg centrifuge. For any experiments requiring a higher centripetal force, a longer spin-time can be used and we will provide a detailed guide should this happen.  While we have already developed relationships with OEMs, depending on the number of backers we may need to find new manufacturing partners in order to meet our timeline. Depending on the method, the final product may be 10 pounds or so heavier.   Finally, with trade tensions around the world riding high and threats of tariffs being thrown around, import taxes may change over the coming months. While we canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t predict the future, we will do our best to find workarounds, and promise that youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be honestly informed of any change in our plans or potential delays in a timely manner. Rest assured, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re a company with a mission to ship our products."

ÃÂÃÂ        Catboxpro was engineered to be the most  reliable  litter box on the market. What does a reliable litter box mean? It means that you can be sure the litter will be sifted and  wasteflushed away every time.                              Today your choice is either to clean the litter box by hand with a scoop or a self-scooping litter box that is as big as a boat and stores waste you still need to empty. Other flushing litter boxes are big and bulky and take 30 Minutes to flush not to mention use outdated technology that is very unreliable and require babysitting. ÃÂÃÂ   The Catboxpro  saves the average cat owner 12 hours per year by doing the chore for you. Speaking of savings, with just 50 fl. oz. of water used per cycle, it's the most economical water-saving litter box on the market.                       Catboxpro measures just  5 inches in height . Sifts, resets bed and flushes all in just  30 Seconds!  Best of all, it's truly a reliable,  quality appliance.  This kind of automatic is not just better but  it's quicker.  Your time is very  precious , do literally anything else, but don't waste it cleaning the litter box. ÃÂÃÂ                             With the Catboxpro, you can  use any flushable litter . It does not even have to be clumping litter. It only needs to absorb liquid very similar to sand. The  Rotary Disk Sifter  requires only a minimum amount of clumping action to work.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   The best part about the Catboxpro is that you don't need to buy chipped cartridges that stop the litterbox from working unless replacements are regularly purchased. Additionally, there's no need to buy plastic litter, fragrances, trays, chemicals, liners, bags  all you need is flushable litter.          Our Accomplishments   It took  4 years to create  the Catboxpro! Our first task was to create a fully functional prototype.  We did it!  We 3d-printed and laser-cut all parts in our garage, investing a  total of $20,000 to make the prototype.  We worked with a local  engineering firm  on the design. Our old design was bulky and needed 5 motors. With just a simple paper drawing, we reconfigured the Catboxpro to run on  just 1 motor  with the same impact. The new prototype was reprinted using new laser-cut and 3d-printed parts. ÃÂÃÂ        In August 2017 we entered into a Shark Tank-like tv show called the  Fast-Track Challange  sponsored by our county. We were one of the  4 finalists picked to present  at the Savage City Hall. Six months later, we shot the Kickstarter video at home and presented the Catboxpro on Kickstarter.  We work on the Catboxpro nearly every day, polishing our campaign, staying in touch with the people who want to be able to own a Catboxpro and always improving.        Did you know that cat feces (litter boxes) could cause a pregnant women to have a miscarriage, or have a stillborn infant or create birth defects? When Toni got pregnant, her and her husband Vernes couldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t imagine having to give up their cat for 9 months. Desperate to avoid  toxoplasmosis , they found a self-cleaning cat box online. However, it did not work as expected. It had design flaws, and needed several modifications to function properly. Frustrated and desperate, Vernes created his own version, and called it ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>CatboxproÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ which allowed them to keep their cat, and have a safe pregnancy.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ                   1) Faster speeds equal less smell in your house.  Catboxpro is very fast, in just 30 seconds all cat waste is gone! That's a new  world record  in the litter box industry! That's as fast as using a toilet. ÃÂÃÂ    2) Flush &gt; Store.  Flushing smelly cat waste is safer, reduces smell time, and best of all there is no dealing directly with smelly litter for you later.   3) Reliable.  Engineered to be dependable and do the job right! There should be no need to babysit a litter box. ÃÂÃÂ    4) Size  - Today's litter boxes are huge. Some reach 30 inches high. Catboxpro is only 5 inches tall, some simple litter trays are the same size, yet the Catboxpro is fully automatic. ÃÂÃÂ    5) No clumping agent . Catboxpro litter does not require clumping agents to be added. Fewer chemicals for your cat to spread around the house.             Specs:    Voltage:220V|110V ÃÂÃÂ     Motor: Faulhaber 10RPM ÃÂÃÂ     Dimensions: Height: 5"" (12.7cm) Width: 14"" (35.5cm) Length: 24"" (60.9cm) ÃÂÃÂ     Water Usage: 10fl/Flush (295ml/Flush); ÃÂÃÂ     Flushes per Cycle: 1-10 (User Defined, Default: 5) ÃÂÃÂ     Litter Max Depth: 2.5"" (6.3cm)      The Catboxpro Dome (cover) keeps litter in.      Afraid of mess from any litter that your cat(s) may scatter when they leave the Catboxpro? We have the option to purchase a dome for the litter box that will take care of this issue. The  Catboxpro Dome , which can be purchased separately, prevents the cat from scattering any litter, saving you further clean-ups and money.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ          Our Market and Industry   The market for the Catboxpro consists of:   First time dads who want their wife and baby to be safe.    Friends and family looking for a perfect baby shower gift.    Early adopters who want the best new gadgets for their pets.    People who HATE scooping stinky cat litter from a filthy cat box.   As parents, Vernes and Toni learned early on about the dangers of toxoplasmosis not only to Toni, but to their child as well. We know that we are not the only parents who want trouble free pregnancies to result in safe and healthy children. That is why we believe pregnant cat lovers and dads everywhere will be will be interested in purchasing this product. Plus, Catboxpro doesn't smell, and once you buy it you do not need to purchase replacement cleaner for it to function. We project that within 2 years of acquiring the necessary funding, we could capture 30-50% of the existing market share from the only other authentically automatic flushing litter box on the market, and here is why:   From 2018-2022, the   global automatic self-cleaning cat litter box market   is expected to grow over  7%  during the forecast period. (Technavio Market Research)    Globally, cat ownership has steadily increased over the years. (Business Wire)    The average household expenditure on pets has increased from 37% in 2014 to 44% in 2015. (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics)    In 2014 Americans spent $58 Billion on their pets, and $70 Billion in 2017. Of which, $15 Billion was spent on pet supplies ( National Pet Owners Survey )ÃÂÃÂ     ÃÂÃÂ  The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has identified toxoplasmosis as one of the most ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ neglected parasitic infections .    More than 60 million people have been chronically infected with toxoplasma gondii. (CDC)    Since 2007 the US fertility rate has declined, but there are still  over 3 Million babies born each year . ( LA Times  and  US Baby Center )    Despite the continuing decline in birth rates, in 2011 the global baby care products market expenditures were $44.7 Billion, and in 2016 that rose to $66.8 Billion. ( Forbes )    Today 68% of all adults own pets and  23% of all adults own cats . Of all men that own pets 21% own cats. Among the demographics  females own more cats than males.  The highest percentage of cat owners are affluent, are between the  ages of 30-39  and live in suburban areas. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ     The top 2 countries with the  highest cat ownership  are  Russia and the United States. ÃÂÃÂ     In 2017 the total number of cats owned as a pet in the United States amounted to about  95.6 million.  In the same year, some  68 percent  of all U.S. households owned at least one pet.ÃÂÃÂ     What Makes Our Team Special        The team consists of husband and wife duo: Vernes Velagic and Toni Wheeler. Vernes handles the back-of-the-house aspects of the company and built all prototypes himself, utilizing his degree in architecture. Toni handles all front-of-the-house operations including marketing and accounting with a degree in accounting.ÃÂÃÂ    Vernes Velagic    Vernes earned a dual Bachelor's Degree in Architecture and German from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.ÃÂÃÂ     Having lived in Frankfurt Germany, as well as Livno Bosnia/Herzegovina he speaks three languages.    Working as a translator, he has been self-employed for many years and supplemented his ÃÂÃÂ income selling various items online.    Being self-taught in electronics, laser cutters, and 3D printers inspired his work on Catboxpro. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ     Toni Wheeler    Toni earned a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting from Missouri Western State University located in St. Joseph, Missouri.    She has had multiple corporate positions within Winfield, its parent company Land O'Lakes, and also Ecolab. During her five years in those positions she managed over 500 accounts, and coordinated multiple international seminars and events.    She is currently a stay-at-home mom to her 2-year-old daughter.   Vernes will be responsible for all of the back-of-the-house operations: inventory, manufacturing, logistics, and design. Toni will manage the front-of-house: accounting, customer interactions, and all marketing. As equal owners, both Toni and Vernes make all final decisions together.      Risks and challenges  At this time, Catboxpro is a working prototype. It has been beta tested, but it is not currently on the market. We have 2 provisional patents on the unique interior parts of the Catboxpro and plan to apply for full patents in the near future. Our goal is to mass produce, so we can decrease the manufacturing price, which will magnify the profit. A complete rollout on the Catboxpro will occur when the right funding partner is acquired. If we do not get the funding acquired, we cannot produce Catboxpro."

And for every bar we sell, we're able to  donate a    hundred    bars  to children and families in need.            Millions of bars of soap are thrown away from hotels around the world  every day . That's  tons  of soap heading to landfills.  Meanwhile, children suffer from deadly diseases that could've been prevented if they'd simply had access to soap.

We've been carrying out our mission to save, sanitize, and supply recycled soap from hotels in developing countries to schools, hospitals, and village communities since 2015.                            We  employ economically disadvantaged women  to collect tons of gently used soap from hotels. We run all that soap through a  three-stage, lab-certified sanitization process . All of our production lines regularly undergo  rigorous inspections by government standards boards . The result is ultra-cleanÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>so clean you could eat it, if it weren't soap :)  We've already prevented  hundreds of tons  of soap from heading to landfills, employing  147 women  in  10  countries to provide more than  1.1 million people  with clean, lifesaving soap.  And now we're thinking bigger.ÃÂÃÂ        We'll use 100% of the funds we raise through this campaign to implement brand new production lines devoted to manufacturing our Project EcoSoap prototypes at scale. This includes:   Hiring  45 more economically disadvantaged women  as soapmakers, providing them with steady, fair-wage employment.    Purchasing  specialized soap finishing equipment  to maintain a high standard of quality at a fast rate of production.   We have virtually no net costs associated with soap collection, and we're able to keep other costs low by utilizing much of our existing infrastructure.  After the campaign, we'll provide frequent updates on our progress. We pledge to be as transparent as possible about how your support is getting put to use.

Risks and challenges  One of the greatest challenges we face is keeping our distribution as environmentally (and financially) sustainable as possible. Eco-Soap Bank has worked abroad since 2015 and has engaged in a fair amount of international shipping. However, since we've never produced a consumer-oriented product, we don't have extensive experience with last-mile distribution. We're currently working to tackle this challenge with a small team of logistics consultantsÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>and we'll be sure to provide updates on our progress.  Another challenge we've faced so far is ensuring that the right kinds of soap are available in the right places, in the right quantities, at the right times. Given that our soap collections from hotels can yield variable amounts, this was originally the primary challenge we had to overcome. Since then, we've been able to solve this problem largely thanks to a more mature and established network of steady partnerships with hotels. Our soap supplies still vary, but we now have many options to make our recycling formula work. Nonetheless, we'll have to continue to monitor our supplies to ensure that production remains smoothly on track."

Using a unique hybrid design, it offers the unparalleled durability of tungsten carbide and increased lateral toughness by laminating with a ductile steel blade. This cutting edge in making knife blades yields the next level of performance in the hand of the user.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ  Get the best blade without compromising.   With a single blade material there is always a tradeoff between durability of the edge and toughness of the blade to take a lateral impact. Up until now, a single material that optimizes both has not been invented. If you want a sharp and durable edge, it comes at the expense of reduced toughness and elasticity. Of course, a tough and softer knife requires frequent sharpening. With the TungstenKnight, you get the best of both worlds with fewer compromises.        Tungsten Knight knives are designed to be used every day and out-perform the competition.   Gone are the days of interrupting your work to sharpen your blade. The hybrid Tungsten Knight blade has a sharp edge with a steel blade that is more durable than any other knife on the market.ÃÂÃÂ         The Tungsten Knight knives are offered with both uncoated and DLC coated blades.   DLC (ta-C) knives have a super hard amorphous diamond coating that also forms the cutting edge. Our DLC is 50% actual SP3 diamond. One of the hardest materials ever offered on hunting knives. Ta-C ÃÂÃÂ offers deep lasting beauty combined with lowest friction surface.ÃÂÃÂ          I've had a passion for breakthrough metals for most of my adult life. I had my epiphany while in a laboratory at Caltech and saw an amorphous metal alloy for the first time. The alloy, fabricated at Cal Tech under a contract from NASA, was like nothing else before. It had properties a metal and a glass at the same time. From this beginning, I went on to found and become the CEO of Liquidmetal Technologies. I wanted to develop commercial applications for this novel material. LMT eventually becoming a public company.ÃÂÃÂ   These beginnings have led me to my latest passion--breaking through the performance limitations of single material knife blade designs by using hybrid designs featuring different metals to optimize the performance of each area of a knife blade.

Tungsten Knight is geared toward real people who have real needs for the best in knife performance. This performance is made possible by our breakthrough hybrid blade design that is eminently practical for demanding, everyday use.  From our first crowdfunding campaign in 2013, our knife design and production team has delivered on our commitments to our backers in multiple crowdfunding campaigns on both Kickstarter and Indiegogo. These earlier projects were with kitchen knives. However, our ideas for a hybrid blade design are particularly suited for knives used by outdoorsmen (and women).  The development of our knife has been virtually de-risked at this juncture. Our efforts going forward are directed toward achieving manufacturing cost reduction by continuous improvement in our processes, in particular with regard to sharpening protocols for the knifeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s very hard tungsten carbide edge. Our production facility is in place and operating, only awaiting acquisition of some capital equipment that the proceeds from the campaign will allow us to acquire in order to fulfill our rewards to our backers.  Part of honoring our commitment to you is our commitment to maintaining ongoing communication with you of our progress (and challenges) both during and after the campaign until you have the product that you chose to back in your hands. We understand the importance of keeping our backers up-to-date and will be in communication with you as developments arise, giving you visibility into your project."

Pamela Adihambo with her Skydration System in October of 2016    A brief synopsis  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Current Solutions NPC (Formerly Skydration Systems) was born in March of 2016.ÃÂÃÂ  Over six months, the team developed a new rainwater collection method, and in Fall of 2016, a prototype of the Skydration rainwater collection system was taken to a village outside of Nairobi, Kenya by our primary contact, Dr. Martin Schmidt (experience and role described below).ÃÂÃÂ  They were tested over the course of a year and a half, and, at the end of this past summer, Jimmy and Dan received a positive report back on the products and system (described below).ÃÂÃÂ  This summer (May 10th - May 18th), Jimmy, Dan, and Dr. Schmidt are traveling to Kenya to setup a beta test with 5 householdsÃÂÃÂ collecting rainwater using the Skydration System.ÃÂÃÂ  Dr. Schmidt is generously sponsoring 50% of the trip's expenses, but Jimmy and Dan need your help to raise $3000 for the trip cost, the production cost, and post-trip research/travel costs.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ      On the day of the first successful Skydration Test.  From Left to Right: Dan Wagner, Jimmy Reddy, Andrew Pluff, and Joe Reznikov (Not pictured: Zach Hennes).    The Team   Jimmy Reddy (President, CEO) is an economics and social entrepreneurship student at Washington University in St. Louis.ÃÂÃÂ  Jimmy is focused on Image Development, Fundraising, Networking, and Logistics.    Dan Wagner (CTO) is an applied physics, economics, and leadership student at the University of Colorado - Boulder.ÃÂÃÂ  Dan is focused on product design, location analysis, data collection, and production/manufacturing liaison.    Andrew Pluff (Branding) is an undergraduate at TCU studying business with a focus in marketing. He is interested in fundraising methods and developing the Current brand.ÃÂÃÂ     Zach Hennes (Utility Player) studies nursing at Creighton University with a research focus in public health. He is looking to make sure that Current adheres to the latest and best public health practices.    Joseph Reznikov (Utility Player) is a pre-med student at St. Louis University. He was one of the original Skydration team members and continues to contribute in any way he can.ÃÂÃÂ     Dr. Schmidt (Board Member) is a professor, pediatrician, and Director of St. Louis University's Medicine Abroad Program.ÃÂÃÂ  He specializes in Tropical Medicine, Hygiene, and Refugee Care.ÃÂÃÂ  For many years, Dr. Schmidt has travelled to Kenya to volunteer for an NGO specializing in nutritional health.    Dr. Kevin Foy (Board Member) teaches economics at St. Louis University High School and has been advising the Current team since its inception. He contributes startup expertise, a sizable professional network, and high-quality common sense advice.ÃÂÃÂ       Networking and Presenting the Skydration System at SLU Medlauch    The Story  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ During Jimmy Reddy's senior year of high school, he began to question the inaccessibility of water for many, and, how, in temperate parts of the world, this problem could be remedied by household rainwater collection. ÃÂÃÂ After recognizing the problem, Jimmy began to build a team. ÃÂÃÂ He brought on Joe Reznikov, Zach Hennes, Andrew Pluff, and Daniel Wagner. ÃÂÃÂ Together, they invented and prototyped a new method of rainwater collection. ÃÂÃÂ During this development phase,ÃÂÃÂ Jimmy met Dr. Schmidt who immediately loved the project and agreed to conduct initial on-site testing in Fall of 2016.     A girl carrying a full, five gallon jerrycan to her home.  A filled jerrycan weighs forty pounds.    ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Kenya Climate Characteristics  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Kenya is located in Subsaharan Africa, and, depending on the location in the country, areas receive anywhere between 20 to 100 cm of rainwater per year.ÃÂÃÂ  Even in the most arid areas of Kenya (20 cm of rainfall per year), a 10 ft x 20 ft roof would provide a family of four with 85% of their drinking water in a year.ÃÂÃÂ  In more climatically moderate areas, a family of four could obtain all water necessary for drinking, cooking, and cleaning (not taking into account rainy/dry season fluctuations).     The Skydration System's central component, the Cap, allows rainwater to be collected in multiple jerrycans arranged in a chain.    ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ The Technology  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ The rainwater collection system developed uses a counterintuitive method to collect and store water.ÃÂÃÂ  Of course, the first step is rain fall (described above in Kenya Climate Characteristics).ÃÂÃÂ  The water flows across the roof, into the gutter, and down a  hose  connected to the gutter via our  Gutter Attacher .ÃÂÃÂ  The hose leads down to the  In-Line Filter  (a steel mesh filter) and into the first  Jerry Can .ÃÂÃÂ  The hose is attached to the can by passing through the first hole of our main product,  The Cap .ÃÂÃÂ  The cap is shaped like a test tube stopper with two holes in its top: one for an in hose and one for an out.ÃÂÃÂ  The cap forms a water tight seal with both the jerry can and the in and out hose.ÃÂÃÂ  After the first can fills up, water is pushed up the out hose which prompts a siphon effect and sends the water into the next can in the line which is also fitted with a cap.ÃÂÃÂ  There is no physical limit to how many cans can be connected in this manner, however, five five-gallon Jerry Cans is recommended for a family of four.ÃÂÃÂ  The water collected in the Cans should be safe to drink but iodine tablets are recommended. ÃÂÃÂ There are several factors currently prohibiting/restricting household rainwater collection, namely: cost, product delivery, and contamination risks.

ÃÂÃÂ The drums are bulky and, therefore, difficult to transport to various rural locations. ÃÂÃÂ Cistern collectors are open to the air and difficult to clean.ÃÂÃÂ  They can be both a breeding ground for water borne illness and malaria-spreading mosquitos. ÃÂÃÂ  Our system costs less than 20 USD per household, weighs less than 10 pounds, fits into a grocery bag, and has built-in water filtering for both particulates and mosquito larvae.    ÃÂÃÂ  The Collection Process ÃÂÃÂ      Collecting Rainwater       (1) Rain is caught on the roof.       (2) Water fills the gutter and enters the down hose.       (3) A filter captures particulates going down the hose.       (4) About five gallons of water fills the first jerrycan.       (5) Pressure pushes overflowing water from the first jerrycan into the second and down the rest of the line.        Risks and challenges  There have been many attempts to address the World Water Crisis.  Some efforts to provide sustainable access to water for the developing world have succeeded while others have failed.  Current believes we have found a niche market that can be specifically addressed by our Skydration technology.  Compared to our competitors, Skydration rainwater collection reduces cost and capitalizes on products already available to our customers.  We do recognize the obstacle of communicating the usefulness of the product and will therefore work to build trust in the communities we enter.  Thank you for your trust and support."

Risks and challenges  We anticipate *many* risks and challenges in organizing a bootcamp for the first time in a remote location. We understand that this is an ambitious vision. We promise to dedicate our efforts to its manifestation and work thoughtfully and diligently to address problems when they come up.  Internet connectivity is our biggest challenge. All we have at the moment is a slow satellite connection. We're working on setting up a link to a nearby location with a broadband connection using directional antennas, but finding a clear line-of-sight may be difficult. We are also preparing servers to create a locally-hosted intranet of necessary course materials.  Inclement weather may present challenges to those camping outside. Proper camping equipment is highly recommended. We can also accommodate up to 25 people with indoor sleeping arrangements."

I went through many treatments as a part of my recovery and massage therapy was one of them. I was so impressed with the progress I was making after have a massage, that I decided to go back to school and learn more about it.  I have been a massage therapist since 2004 and have worked with chiropractors and physical therapists in different offices, gyms, and spas.   I love what I do and I am very passionate about helping people feel better.   According to my experience, only about 1 in 10 people today come in for a massage because they want to relax. The majority of my clients and patients book a massage because they are in so much pain, it prevents them from living a normal, happy life.  My clients often tell me about muscle pain they have been living with for a week before they could come to see me.  As part of my job, I am always working with my hands and I constantly suffer from sore shoulders. I couldn't massage myself because these areas are very difficult to reach. I have tried every self-massage device on the market, but I was never really satisfied. I started using a tennis ball against the wall to release my sore muscles and that was the moment when the idea for the WALLssager began.   I knew how easy it was to release sore muscles and I wanted to create a simple, small, portable device that would do just that.""        After a year of searching and working with different prototypes and sharing our vision with clients, patients, chiropractors, and physical therapists, we finally created the WALLssager.  We trademarked the name and at the end of 2016 we received the patent.  In 2017 we attended the world's largest startup expo - TECHDAY in NYC, and had a lot of success. Since then we have been selling the product and have gotten amazing feedback from everyone who has purchased one.            It has been a long journey and we have put in a lot of work to perfect the WALLssager. Now we are ready or a big purchase order.ÃÂÃÂ   With your support we can bring our product to a larger audience and help even more people live pain-free lives.  Thank you for your interest and taking time to learn more about the WALLssager.

The Vezo prototype is 100% complete, and we have a top Korean manufacturing facility ready to start production as soon as the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign finishes.  We are confident that we will meet or beat our estimated delivery dates. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be keeping in regular contact with our backers so youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll know whatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s happening every step of the way.  That said, things could go wrong, from natural to man-made disasters. Who knows? We may not be fortune-tellers, but we promise that we have taken every possible precaution to make sure that Vezo is manufactured as quickly and as efficiently as possible so we can ship it out to our backers without delay.  We have big plans for Vezo and for ArVizon. After the Kickstarter, Vezo will be offered as a B2B solution for fleet management. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve already started development of a web application that will enable businesses to manage fleets of thousands of vehicles. Our ambitions go so far beyond this single Kickstarter, so please rest assured that we are 100% committed to making this happen."

We present the  HyperTrack ! The first Hyperloop test track in Spain will be built at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, and we are counting on you to make this possible. You can help us to get even closer to test our prototype by sponsoring  one meter of the rail !  We would need at least  one hundred meter s in order to  test our prototype  prior to the Competition, but with three hundred meters we could run at  much greater speeds  and even having the possibility of  levitating  in the near future.               OUR STORY   ÃÂÃÂ Hyperloop UPV is a student team from the Universitat PolitÃÂÃÂ©cnica de ValÃÂÃÂ¨ncia (UPV) with the aim of constructing  a functional prototype of a complete Hyperloop system  and to bring the transportation of the future  closer to reality.ÃÂÃÂ       Timeline of Hyperloop UPV    Hyperloop UPV  started in October 2015.  Five students from UPV decided to participate in the Hyperloop Design Weekend Competition  organised by Space X in Texas in January 2016. In this competition a jury composed of Tesla and SpaceX experts  awarded Hyperloop UPV the Best Overall Concept Design and Best Propulsion System . The design that Hyperloop UPV proposed  was the only one  which was able to levitate by  attraction to the top of the tube , which meant significantly lowering the infrastructure costs. ÃÂÃÂ      The first prototype: Atlantic II     Atlantic II  is the prototype which was developed for the  Hyperloop Pod Competition II , organized by SpaceX in August 2017. The  Atlantic II  earned a place among the  top 10 teams globally,  with more than 300 universities participating. SpaceX confirmed that the Hyperloop technologies implemented on the prototype where exceptional, naming it the  most powerful Pod  in the competition.ÃÂÃÂ      The second prototype: Valentia    Even more powerful than its predecessor, ÃÂÃÂ with an  amazingly improved technology ,  Valentia  also included an  outstanding new design  combining futuristic and aerodynamic outlines. In July 2018, Hyperloop UPV competed against 17 classified universities and was ranked, for the second year in a row,  among the top 10 Pods  of the Hyperloop Pod Competition III, occupying the eighth position. The  Valentia  prototype caused admiration among engineers for its innovative design. ÃÂÃÂ Its  elegance was even admitted  by our advisors from SpaceX, alongside all the other competing teams.     Hyperloop UPV 2019 Team    This yearÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s team is composed of  40 brilliant and highly motivated students  helped out by professors from many departments who act as advisors. SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition IV will be held in summer 2019 and the team is  working hard in designing and constructing  a new functional prototype. This new prototype uses a disruptive design which the team hopes will ensure they win the competition when they return to California.     Turian will be revealed on May 10      Turian   is the name of this year's prototype,  a lighter, faster and more aerodynamic Pod  that will compete next July against the best technological universities on the planet. It will be  revealed to the whole world next May 10 , in an event where all the sponsors will be able to enjoy a unique ceremony, where they will be able to get to know the whole team and know all the parts of the prototype.  That's why  we need to build the test track , to be able to compete on equal terms and be able to test our prototype before the competition. Thanks to the rail, we can pass all the tests, from propulsion to electronics and SpaceX engineers will be happy :)      Risks and challenges  Our challenge is to get the biggest amount of rail meters possible to test our Hyperloop prototype, Turian, at maximum speed, around 400Km / h.  As a team of non-profit students, we have many difficulties when it comes to obtaining financing. At the time of manufacturing our prototype, we are covered, but this year we want to go even further and be able to test our prototype here, at our home, at the UPV, in Valencia, to get to Los Angeles with everything tested. It is a point of inflection that we must overcome in order to improve ourselves and win in the competition."

AbleChair is a revolutionary way to give people with disabilities the chance to regain such an important part of their lives.   ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Exercise is Optional, Movement is Essential.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ    ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>The human body is designed to be upright. Our bones, muscles, organs, and nervous system function optimally when upright, either walking or standing.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂÃÂÃÂ    People with physical disabilities often have fewer opportunities to be physically active. Being able to gait train or simply stand from a wheelchair is a dream come true for many. The biggest problem being in a regular wheelchair is that people are limited to being in the exact same position and the exact same height all the time.ÃÂÃÂ   AbleChair is a revolutionary power wheelchair. The AbleChair is the most versatile wheelchair in the world, combining the benefits of mobility, therapy, position control, and transfers. It allows users to be put in any number of positions through a wireless phone app for added convenience and enables users to save and recall their favorite positions with the touch of a button. The therapeutic benefits of the AbleChair are priceless.ÃÂÃÂ   If you or your loved one is disabled, the AbleChair is the ultimate gift that could ever be received - ÃÂÃÂ it is the gift of independence that keeps on giving. Nothing has more value than our independence, and some people are robbed of their independence due to physical issues.         You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

This level of convenience and efficiency gives people a chance to recover.  AbleChair empowers wheelchair users with increased independence and improved health. We want to make the AbleChair the best experience possible and we want to ensure the highest levels of comfort and independence.ÃÂÃÂ        The AbleChair is an all-in-one wheelchair with a fraction of the cost of any sophisticated/specialty wheelchair. Thanks to many years of hard work that we managed to come up with the perfect balance of cost and value.ÃÂÃÂ   The AbleChair has the power to change millions of lives in the wheelchair community with radical results that will make each person suffering from disabilities feel much better.ÃÂÃÂ          We are offering exceptional discounts on a very limited number of AbleChair units . An innovative option with the lowest price and an unmatched functionality not found in other specialty wheelchairs. We know the Kickstarter community is going to see the extreme value that comes from backing this project. This is also going to allow us to further promote AbleChair in the wheelchair community.ÃÂÃÂ      AbleChair Sit to Stand Function         Every year millions of people are forced to use wheelchairs ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> some for a short period of time, and others for a lifetime. The reasons include strokes, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, multiple sclerosis, weakness in bones and joints, aging, arthritis, hip and knee replacements, etc. There are many other reasons that could force a person to use a wheelchair, but the end result is the same, people need to be able to feel comfortable, but most importantly, they need to maintain their independence.ÃÂÃÂ   ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s essential for the wheelchair to evolve into a better solution for those who wish to have some form of independence. AbleChair is the next step in that evolution. One that is going to give people in wheelchairs a life-changing opportunity.  Existing wheelchairs have failed to adequately address the needs of the users i.e. provide necessary therapeutic functions, resulting in increased dependence, gradual deterioration of health or excessive cost burden on an ongoing basis. These wheelchairs also frequently put caregivers, family members or therapists in helpless situations.ÃÂÃÂ         Important statistics about wheelchair users:    Spends an average of 10-14 hours in the wheelchair    Transferred out of the wheelchair 6-12 times    Performs pressure reliefs by off-loading of the entire buttocks 5-10 timesÃÂÃÂ     Performs weight shifts from one side of the buttocks 30-40 times per day   13.2 million non-institutionalized adults receive an average of 31.4 hours of personal assistance in ADLs and IADLs per week, which costs about $314/week, or $16,328/year   Insufficient or delayed therapy may cause permanent damage to body functions. In some cases, it may not even be practical to receive much-needed therapy as often as the user should.ÃÂÃÂ    The AbleChair promotes early therapy at the convenience of home for an accelerated, positive outcome. In most cases, users can independently gait-train with controlled weight bearing almost anywhere and anytime they want, which will lead to a faster recovery. Savings on services such as PT, OT and ADL, alone can easily pay for the AbleChair in a short period of time.ÃÂÃÂ   This is a completely new level of independence that is revolutionizing the way we look at wheelchairs and also the way people perceive those with disabilities. Feeling capable is just as important as being independent. The AbleChair allows people to handle daily tasks that would be impossible with a regular wheelchair.        The AbleChair has full range independent adjustment of tilt angle and seat angle , providing flexible and practically limitless positions to perfectly suit wheelchair users. Benefits include:   pressure relief maintaining range of motion    helping to manage spasticity    and increasing sitting tolerance    Reduce transfers as the users can get into comfortable positions    improve bone density    Provide means for weight shifts    stretch muscles    increased blood circulation    improved lung function    Eliminate poor postures resulting from fatigue              Giving people with disabilities a chance to go higher or lower has never been so easy!   Its extended lift adjustment allows standard elevated sitting and beyond as well as lowered sitting all the way down to the floor. The benefits include:   Elevated sitting provides eye-level conversation with peers promoting better posture and psychological benefits    Better access and reach to higher level objects (sinks, countertops, top shelves)    ""For those who would love to get on the ground on a regular basis, the AbleChair is the wheelchair for you.  This wheelchair has the ability to lower the seat completely to the ground , so all you have to do is transfer out of the chair and then get right back into the seat. This feature is where this wheelchair shines, as there are no other wheelchairs on the market that can do this. Just think of all the activities you can do with this. From taking care of a baby and getting on the floor next to them to cleaning your house or doing some yoga, this ability can change the life of someone with spinal cord injury that has trouble getting to the ground.""[spinalcord.com]             Together with full range tilt and seat adjustments,  the AbleChair has incredible height adjustment feature , which allows the users to stand safely and comfortably. The benefits of standing include:   Decrease tightness and muscle spasms caused by core and lower extremity movementÃÂÃÂ     Increase bone density due to increased load on the bones    Heal pressure ulcers by eliminating or reducing lateral pressure on the body    Improve bowel function due to standing up exercises    Reduce muscle spasticity caused by prolonged sitting    Increase circulation by reducing stagnation due to sitting    Improve respiration by increasing space for diaphragm expansion    Become independent by having greater reachÃÂÃÂ     Reduce fatigue by reducing muscle atrophy    Improve overall well-being              A unique and outstanding opportunity for optimal gait therapy results!   The AbleChair is the only wheelchair on the market that offers gait therapy with controlled weight bearing. Within seconds, the AbleChair can become an effective gait system, so you can practice walking at home and eliminate the need for a transfer or a trip to a clinic. It also goes back to the lying position, so you can truly take a break when you are exhausted. You can continue these gait training cycles as often as you wish for faster recovery.ÃÂÃÂ   The power mobility of the AbleChair will assist you in gently pushing you along safely, and of course, you can control the pace as needed.  It is quite difficult to predict how far someone will go with gait training. But even for those who will never achieve independent functional ambulation, there are still many opportunities to make significant gains.  Static loading of the bones is less effective in bone development than dynamic loading. Dynamic weight bearing is a loading and unloading of the skeleton that typically occurs during weight shifting in gait or stand. It is important for weight bearing activities to be routine and regular, to maintain and continue bone growth and development.  Gait training benefits include:   Promotes joint and bone development    Prevents contractures and increases motion    Improves lung function    Better bowel and bladder function    Better circulation    Decreased constipation    Decreased spasticity    Lower risk of pressure sores    Improved cognition growth with environmental exploration    Improved visual awareness    Promotes a more active lifestyle        ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ A solid structure that gives people the power to move with confidence!   The AbleChair is also a full-function power wheelchair with speed limit settings, electromagnetic breaking and drive engagement levers.ÃÂÃÂ           AbleChair in mini van       Size comparison with conventional wheelchairs                   We are offering free frame color options ($199 value) for free during this campaign. These are tentative colors and will be finalized after knowing preferences from the backers. Orange red color is what is used for the units shown in the video/pictures. Note that the parts shown in black will continue to be in black.  ÃÂÃÂ Note 1: Final product specifications may change based on the production design.  Note 2: $300 shipping charge will be added to the amount for product rewards. This amount is for shipping anywhere within the contiguous United States.       We have been designing and manufacturing our award-winning SpinoFlex gait training products for the past 18 years. These products have been in use mostly at clinics and some at homes. All users of our products, not being able to walk, use wheelchairs for their mobility. The transfers between the wheelchairs and the gait training devices is an involved process, many times requiring help from others. It is also uncomfortable both physically and psychologically for the users while being transferred. Often, after getting treatment for a brief period, users tend to get tired and break the session only to reverse the transfer process to get back to the wheelchairs. ÃÂÃÂ The task of traveling to the clinics also takes time, again requiring multiple transfers between the transportation vehicle and the wheelchair.ÃÂÃÂ    This process besides being involved and expensive,  ÃÂÃÂ  discourages users from getting necessary treatment in terms of duration and frequency   ÃÂÃÂ and hence it may not be as effective as it could have been.ÃÂÃÂ    So, we got the idea of adding gait therapy to wheelchairs to make it much easier, effective and inexpensive. The major design goals were power mobility, independent gait therapy, strength and durability, and clean and stylish look. These posed several design and development challenges. After building several prototypes we were successfully able to build models that satisfied our goals.ÃÂÃÂ    Now, we need your help to make this a reality that is accessible to a larger population!   When you decide to support this project, you will be changing millions of lives once we are able to meet our backing goals!  All great things begin with a vision, but they only become a reality when other people are able to see that vision and help it come to fruition.   Back this project today and give the ultimate gift to those who need it!                  ÃÂÃÂ The goal was to develop a single column compact user support mechanism that includes flexible position controls from the SpinoFlex dual column system. We wanted to quickly build a prototype to get a feel ÃÂÃÂ for performance using our custom aluminum extrusions, steel tubing and plywood panels. The idea was to create space for the user to stand or walk when the seat was folded down.       ÃÂÃÂ Then we added tilt mechanism and did some basic testing, and the performance was very disappointing. The frame was flexing a lot and the actuators were weak besides being noisy. So we replaced plywood panels with steel frames. We also replaced the frame with stronger steel tubing. The heavy duty aluminum extrusions used for vertical movement was designed for the SpinoFlex frames and has been in use from the beginning with great performance.       ÃÂÃÂ We added stronger and quieter actuators for tilt and seat movements. We tested brushless wheelchair motors on a frame and attached the motors to the AbleChair prototype.       ÃÂÃÂ We tried the movements using momentary rocker switches for on/off and direction change. This seemed to be working OK. After some stress testing the actuator gears were stripped. Because of the way the user is supported, we needed very strong drive components due to resulting high cantilever forces. We replaced the existing ones with the strongest and quiet actuators we could find. We also replaced the back support arm with stronger steel plates for additional rigidity. Though the brushless motors and controllers sounded good, the motors looked weak and the controller failed after some use. It was a reliability issue so we decided to replace them with stronger brushed motors and controller sets.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ With a few more changes, the frame felt rigid enough and we added seats and armrests. The above left picture shows initial weight testing. We had to use relays and push buttons to drive the motors better. We took the prototype for a test drive with about 200 lbs user. It worked fine for the most part but one of the 40A relays fused due to high current switching.       ÃÂÃÂ We tried many different motor controllers that we could find, but only a couple worked well for us. We used a Bluetooth remote control, a raspberry pi, motor controller and a custom made circuit board to drive the position control motors. Using software we were able to prevent relay switching when current is flowing, ensuring safe switching. The software also controlled acceleration and deceleration so it was also more comfortable for the users, avoiding sudden movements. The entire user support component was attached to the wheel base by a single bolt. The AbleChair used two mounting points to the user support component at different heights, so the base can be switched to another base with the user in the wheelchair. The base need not be a wheelbase, it can be column, wall, pole or other device, built for a specific purpose. The middle picture above shows an example larger wheelbase. The right side picture shows the first pre-production model under development. This became a mid wheel drive model for tighter turns and increased stability as shown in the video.       The picture above left shows the first pre-production model under development. Seat and back pads can be changed easily in the model. The right side picture is the second pre-production model. We lowered the back pivot point for better performance and developed a phone app to drive Arduino based controller for controlling motors and reading sensors. ÃÂÃÂ The previous raspberry pi based controls took about 15 seconds to boot, which could be too long for the users. It also did not have user feedback. The Arduino based controls start instantly and users get touch screen based flexible controls, and can get great feedback from the system. The phone app above right shows control buttons, speed, lift height, tilt and seat angles. Functionality can be enhanced through software updates.

This one is being driven by the wifi module, which extracts time &amp; date from the network.    The Nixie clock IX is ÃÂÃÂ also available in kit form, for those who may already have their own nixies, or want to create their own enclosure, or just enjoy the challenge of building it themselves!ÃÂÃÂ      Silkscreen layer of the MiniNixie4 pc boards, 5870 style boards on the left, IN-16 boards  on the right.            Size is approximately 3"" x 3"" x 3"" with the 5870's.       The CD79 nixies truly are sharply defined and clean looking!            The side view with the 5870's.                      The IN-16 version, finished prototype.       The IN-16's have a normal shaped ""5"".       These are the nixies I sourced today, also Japanese and very similar to CD79s but slightly bigger! Also, I made an example of the blue tinted cover.        Risks and challenges  The biggest challenge this time was to try to incorporate as many of the features of the full sized nixie clock as possible. Given the limited space, this really was challenging! The features included are the gps / wifi module, the toggle on / off at pre-set times routine, and the led underlighting which makes the nixies look so much more interesting."

ÃÂÃÂ After going live with our technology, we will be ready to take it nation-wide to the rest of our pledged partners. ÃÂÃÂ We believe customers and players will love our revolutionary product, and we will need to prioritize where we deploy.

ÃÂÃÂ   We want HRVR rooms in every major metropolitan area in the US, and we are doing everything we can to get there as soon as possible.

But, we aren't stopping at shooters. ÃÂÃÂ We're currently designing content for multiple gaming genres with exciting new controller form factors to match the experience. ÃÂÃÂ Ultimately, we want to release a Software Development Kit (SDK) so that anyone can host their content on our platform.

To speed up the deployment of the new HRVR rooms, we have heavily focused on the cloud and simplicity."

Our goal is to re-think and transform traditional bed linen into something that fits modern-day society. We think that it is possible to make bed linen functional without compromising on design. ÃÂÃÂ        Dawn Nights - Always fresh bed linen  We introduce Dawn Nights. Bed linen that stays fresh and you do not have to wash it that often. Our bed linen is  treated with PolygieneÃÂÃÂ®  using a low concentration of recycled silver chloride, which is naturally present in water and soil. The treatment is  BluesignÃÂÃÂ® ÃÂÃÂ approved , which means it meets rigorous independent environmental and product life cycle standards. PolygieneÃÂÃÂ® is applied in the last stages of the production, and is only active on the textile itself and interfere with your natural skin flora.        The PolygieneÃÂÃÂ® reduce odor-causing bacteria  giving you a comfortable and healthy sleep. Our bed linen reduces the bacteria that cause odor and eventually damages your skin and health, making your bed linen stay fresh for longer.ÃÂÃÂ By keeping your bed linen bacteria free you do not have to wash it that often and therefore save the planet, by using less water resources. Research has shown that two-thirds of a products environmental impact happens in the consumer period by washing and drying.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        We made a bed linen that symbolizes our values and personalities - three guys that love quality, simple design and being in nature. Therefore our bed linen is made of  100% organic cotton, Oeko-Tex certified  and with a 200 thread count.ÃÂÃÂ    Our bed linen is stonewashed with a percale weave  that gives the bed linen a crisp and lively look. The fabric becomes soft and makes the bedlinen light and breathable. The design is inspired by Nordic nature and a minimalistic way of thought, to make a bed linen that has a  timeless design and will last longer than most . Initially, Dawn Nights come in two colorways - a broken white and a blue inspired by the coastline around Denmark.  Packaging - Reusable tote bag  To reduce the waste after producing our bed linen we have used the leftovers to create a tote bag. It will function as packaging and you can use it afterward for carrying things while on the move.ÃÂÃÂ        Which size to choose?       Production in Portugal             Our products are produced in Portugal by our supplier that has   over 30 years of experience in manufacturing textile products . They have a sense for traditional handcraft and dedicated quality control, which makes them able to create high standard products.ÃÂÃÂ   We have visited the factory two times to control the quality and conditions for the workers. All the process from spinning the yarn to the finishing details and the PolygieneÃÂÃÂ® ÃÂÃÂ treatment has been centered near the supplier to reduce transportation and the pollution from logistics.ÃÂÃÂ         Our story      Dawn Designs' founding team    We are Dawn Designs. Three guys Rasmus, Thomas and Tjelle from Aarhus in Denmark with an urge to create something functional and sustainable that can help the everyday life. So we sat down, focused andÃÂÃÂ went through our daily schedules and chores to see where problems arose.ÃÂÃÂ What is the first thing we do? We wake up in our bed and... Our creative process stopped right there.ÃÂÃÂ   The bed is actually a big problem, and it gives birth to bacteria and swamps.ÃÂÃÂ Dermatologist advise you to  wash your bedlinen every 14th day , which actually does not sound that difficult. But to be honest, how many of us actually do that? We did not, but now we wanted to change it. We contacted experts to hear about different ways to make the bed a fresh and clean place to sleep. We did not want anything chemical, but a natural way that would not harm our human body or the planet we live on. One day we heard about the ancient way of using silver because of its antibacterial and heat-regulating function, and after some research, we finally found the way to keep bed linen fresh by using recycled silver chloride.ÃÂÃÂ    What is next?   After traveling to Portugal, discussing details with our supplier, we have now received our first samples of the products. Actually, we only need one more thing - your help! Help us creating a fresh and sustainable way of sleeping by funding this project.        Stay tuned. Stay fresh.                            Risks and challenges  We have done a lot of research over the last year and have close cooperation with our experienced supplier. We have been talking to several previous project owners, which have given us a lot of advice, what we need to do to make a successful Kickstarter campaign.    The technology is well documented, and we know that you backers will like our product. But the thing we are mostly sure about is that this project has to be run by us. A passionate and ambitious team of guys, who are willing to work very hard for this project."

However, like many projects, there are a number of risks and challenges that we need to mitigate before we can get the TiSTICK to each one of you. We would like to keep you informed how production is progressing and what is the current standing.  First, there are risks associated with the manufacturing of any high technologies products. The process of mass production is very different than prototype development. We developed relationships with key manufacturing partners, we ordered and received the essential components for a large batch of TiSTICKs.  Secondly, there are risks associated with the logistics to physically deliver of the TiSTICK to you. This will be the first time we are shipping our product, it is difficult for us to estimate the volume of product we will be sending, as well as their destinations. To help overcome this challenge, we have been working closely with DHL who has enough of experience retailing products to customers worldwide and on time.  We are looking in the future full of confidence. With your support and our team, we are in a position to overcome all challenges and produce a high-quality product, we want to create best and safest USB-Stick in the world.  CEO JÃÂÃÂ¶rg Lingg"

Hio provides a huge security experience, available to the individuals or businesses, on getting secure and fast access to all the devices. It alleviates the security burden of traditional password-based authentication to protect internet users worldwide.ÃÂÃÂ   Hio relies on hardware to keep all the sensitive data you have, such as passwords and credit cards, physically protected. With Hio, now, sign-in is secure and even much easier on any device simply by a click or double-tap. It ensures your privacy by immediately locking your PC when you walk away, and unlocking your PC when you walk back using a standard password-less authentication solution.                 We would like to keep Hio growing by expanding its functionalities and enhancing its appearance as long as possible. Here are what we would like to add if we manage to exceed our initial Kickstarter goal.                 We've perfected a leather keychain that is handcrafted from high-quality genuine leather. The leather now comes in Gray color with a simple, functional design. Incorporating a very stylish solid ring, Hio keychain can simply be used for your other physical keys for added peace of mind.  Due to the nature of the leather and because each individual item is made by hand, you can expect that each one will be unique.                 Handing data off to a public cloud provider poses many security and privacy concerns. As data is stored distantly and is accessible from anywhere on the internet if a data breach occurs via hacking your data can be compromised. Breaches across almost every public cloud service continue to be regularly reported by the media.  In cloud-based password manager, as user security information is stored on the cloud, passwords, payment information, and much more, your entire password database is vulnerable to a data breach. When a data breach occurs, no amount of protection will keep your usersÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> accounts protected.ÃÂÃÂ   Hio goes completely cloud-less, keeping all your data securely encrypted inside the chip. No data will be stored, exchanged or even computed on the Internet keeping users protected against hacking and data breaches.                      ÃÂÃÂ In today's increasingly interconnected world, a majority of computer users are suffering from ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>security fatigueÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ- a weariness or reluctance to deal with computer security- that exposes online users to risky computing behavior at work and in their personal lives, according to a new study by government scientists. This can cause computer users to feel hopeless and overwhelmed by security.   ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>I get tired of rememberingÃÂÃÂ my username and passwords.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ, was a resentful testimony of one of the participants in a recent US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) study.ÃÂÃÂ     ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Years ago, you had oneÃÂÃÂ password to keep up with at work,ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ added another irked participant in thisÃÂÃÂ study. ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Now people are being asked to remember 25 or 30. We havenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t reallyÃÂÃÂ thought about cybersecurity expanding and what it has done to peopleÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ.    ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>It also bothers me when IÃÂÃÂ have to go through more additional security measures to access my things, or get locked out of my own account because I forgot as I accidentally typed in my password incorrectlyÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ, found among participants comments.                 In this video from NIST, Mary Theofanos explains the idea of security fatigue and how users are bogged down by too many decisions involving their online security.                      Hio emphasizes sophisticated security protocols, ensuring absolute device safety, for keeping all the sensitive information you have physically protected inside the chip. It gives you a simple way to access websites and applications that doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t involve memorizing a long list of unrelated characters. You donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t need to spend time filling out fields of information, trying to understand complex instructions, or thinking up a secure password and username for the account. It automatically prompts you to store passwords physically secure when you are logging to a website for the first time. Managing passwords with Hio is super easy; all you need to sign in, is, just a click or double-tap on the Hio key.ÃÂÃÂ             Never worry about locking your PC as you leave your vicinity with it. With Magic Lock, now, Hio simply figures out and immediately locks your PC in your absence. No one else is offering an automatic locking system with such accuracy and effectiveness. We have applied a powerful, movement-based solution which allows you to select your desired distance from the four predefined options: 2-step, 4-step, 6-step, and 8-step.   Constantly collect and analyzeÃÂÃÂ accelerometer data to detect user movement    Check for the availability or strength of the Bluetooth signal to avoid false alarm    If the user walked beyond the determined step threshold and the Bluetooth signal is weak the screen will be locked instantaneously             Hio, as a Windows Hello companion device, enriches user authentication experience forÃÂÃÂ Windows 10.   Wait for user to click or press the spacebar on the keyboard    Check for the availability or strength of the Bluetooth connection    The PC will be unlocked if you are about 2 steps close to your PC             Like the other security keys, Hio key has a specific secure chip by which it performs cryptographic functions triggered by a push button. Obviously, you never see the details, but behind the scenes, it provides a robust secure infrastructure as a way to protect your passwords, credit cards and the login credentials of Windows Hello unlock authentication solution.  The secure chip that is used in Hio key is an ARMÃÂÃÂ® TrustZoneÃÂÃÂ® Cryptocell chip which ensures your credentials of any type are real, untampered, and confidential. It features hardware acceleration for the NIST standard prime curve and supports the complete key life cycle from high quality private key generation to ECDSA signature generation, ECDH key agreement, and ECDSA public key signature verification.ÃÂÃÂ   As the result, we keep the userÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s secrets securely protected inside the chip with the hardware protection. This includes protection for passwords to all websites and applications, credit card and other sensitive data. Hio, a PIN capable device, provides industry leading security so you can be confident that no one can read your data even if your Hio key is lost or stolen. The credentials contained in the Hio key belong to the end-user exclusively and are never transferred, copied or stored by a service provider or any other application provider.       By setting up a device Pin, the user automatically enables enhanced transaction security over sensitive information. This means an attacker in possession of Hio key canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t get access to data without the PIN. To further discourage brute-force passcode attacks, there are escalating time delays after 5 consecutive incorrect attempts to enter the Pin. With a six-character alphanumeric code, it would take many years for thieves and computer programs to try all combinations. This is to safeguard your data in case you lose your Hio key and someone tries to use it without your authorization.                                     If you regularly lock your PC when you leave your desk, then I'll say you will be happy with Hio. It can guarantee your privacy by triggering to lock your PC when you forget to lock your PC or tablet when you step away. Perhaps when you leave your desk for a cup of coffee or to have a conversation with your colleague.ÃÂÃÂ   Additionally, Hio key can be used as a companion device instead of a password to sign in faster and more secure to your Windows devices, apps and Microsoft Edge websites.         Logging to a website from anywhere with any platform is easily achievable just by a click or double-tap. Hio saves users from the hassle of entering password on each time getting access to websites and applications. It gives users a simple way to access that doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t involve memorizing a long list of characters.         Hio is a hardware digital wallet that allows you to do away with physical cards. It enriches user experience with online shopping for all e-commerce websites. Thus, when youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re checking out online, thereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s no more need to go find your wallet and painstakingly type in your credit card number.                 We have built an amazing secure key that is ready to go, right out of the box. We have suppliers in place and prototype is already complete. The next step is to move to mass production, to create molds, prepare assemblies, with all the same level of quality. This requires investment, and we hope to earn your support to launch the product and grow the community.       Hio guarantees complex passwords, auto-fills passwords across all well-known browsers and mobile applications. Managing passwords with Hio is super easy; all you need to start, is, just a click or tap on the Hio key.       ÃÂÃÂ Through all platforms, Hio provides the highest level of convenience and functionality the users expect regarding OSs restrictions. It is already available for Windows, iOS, and Android, and is under development for Mac OS. In Windows and Mac OS desktop systems, Hio uses the extensions to manage userÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s passwords across all popular browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and safari. It allows you to control all your account easily through your PC, Laptop, tablet or smartphone.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        A cheerful and intuitive user interface designed in-house, delivering easy management for accounts, quick access to accountsÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> data, proximity, security, and device connection settings.ÃÂÃÂ                                       Compatible with various devices and platforms including Windows, Android, iOS and Mac OS, offering a similar set of features to all, Hio is your perfect companion device regardless of your device preference. Completely cloud-less, it connects seamlessly by Bluetooth to your device and ensures information is accessible anytime, anyplace using any device. ÃÂÃÂ                   For IT and Business segment, Hio is going to be a great gadget in the world providing an awesomely secure experience in getting access to your accounts anywhere using any device, a personal laptop, smartphone, or from a shared computer in an office, library, laboratory, and etc.                 The heart of our fast-speed technology, the custom PCB, is assembled with an advanced Bluetooth 5 Nordic SoC (nRF52 Series), security module, accelerometer sensor, LED, and a button. Hio now features a replaceable battery, but depending on how much we raise on this campaign it may be upgraded with a rechargeable technology.            Hio is aesthetically a unique and pleasing device allowing you to carry it with yourself easily as a keychain. Hio features a sensible pushing button and an RGB LED used to show the connection and BLE operation status. As a reward for spending much time on designing and innovating, we proudly receive fantastic feedback from the tech, fashion and design communities. We went through dozens of different designs before finalizing the shape and function of our innovation. We will use your feedback to ensure that the Hio does what you need it to.                                                                                                                  People like you. Thanks to Kickstarter for helping us in broadcasting our idea, solution publicly with all lovers around the world. We're a small company striving to battle some of the largest competitors in the world.

Amazing dynamic range : ÃÂÃÂ Joulescope accurately measures electrical current over 9 orders of magnitude from amps down to nanoamps. This wide range allows accurate and precise current measurement for modern devices. ÃÂÃÂ Sleep modes are often just nanoamps (nA) or microamps (ÃÂÃÂµA). ÃÂÃÂ Active modes are often milliamps (mA) or amps (A). ÃÂÃÂ         Low voltage drop : ÃÂÃÂ Most multimeters and current meters have a significant voltage drop (sometimes called burden voltage or insertion loss) which effects the actual voltage delivered to the device under test. Joulescope has a total voltage drop of 25 mV at 1 A, which keeps your target device running correctly. ÃÂÃÂ Joulescope's extremely fast current range switching maintains low voltage drop even under rapidly varying current demands.        Makes the invisible visible : ÃÂÃÂ Joulescope measures current and voltage 2 million times per second with 250 kHz bandwidth. ÃÂÃÂ This high sampling rate makes the power consumption of interrupt service routines, inrush currents and other short events visible.ÃÂÃÂ    Easy to use : ÃÂÃÂ Joulescope reports cumulative energy consumption along with real-time current, voltage, and power. The multimeter view clearly shows the most recent value while the oscilloscope view allows you to explore changes over time. ÃÂÃÂ Much simpler and more accurate than anything in its class!ÃÂÃÂ         Customizable:  ÃÂÃÂ The Joulescope host software is open source on github. ÃÂÃÂ You can also swap the banana jack front panel with front panels that have other connector types! ÃÂÃÂ The front panels are open source on github. ÃÂÃÂ We ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¤ open source.        Portable : Joulescope fits in your backpack and only needs a small part of your desk. ÃÂÃÂ Take Joulescope wherever you want to use it!   Affordable : ÃÂÃÂ Joulescope is affordable and priced so that every developer on the team can have one at their desk. ÃÂÃÂ With such convenient access, Joulescope empowers developers to see the impact of their changes on energy consumption immediately. ÃÂÃÂ Developers can make informed choices to account for battery life during design. Eliminate power consumption surprises during final product testing!ÃÂÃÂ   How does Joulescope work?  Joulescope simultaneously measures current and voltage, and then computes power and energy. ÃÂÃÂ Joulescope combines a voltmeter and a fast auto-range current shunt ammeter.ÃÂÃÂ        Both the voltage and current are sampled 2 million times per second, and the sample data is sent to the computer. ÃÂÃÂ As the current changes, the ammeter selects the optimal shunt resistor value. ÃÂÃÂ The shunt value selection uses the ADC output, dedicated over-range comparators, and a unique algorithm that runs in an FPGA.  The sensor side of Joulescope is electrically isolated from the host computer. ÃÂÃÂ This allows you to insert Joulescope into your test system without worrying about ground issues including ground loops and ground noise. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ You don't need to worry about settings or affecting your target device. ÃÂÃÂ Joulescope just works.ÃÂÃÂ   Specifications   -1V to 15V voltage range    -1A to 3A current range, continuous    Up to 10A pulses (&lt; 10 ms, &lt; 3A average per second)    Down to 1.5 nA resolution, equivalent to 32-bits of dynamic range    Synchronously measures voltage and current at 2 million samples per second    250 kHz bandwidth    Rapid 1 ÃÂÃÂ¼s switching between shunt resistors for seamless dynamic current measurement    Computes power and total energy    Operates with minimal voltage disturbance between IN and OUT ports    Up to ÃÂÃÂ±48V common mode voltage between USB ground and IN-, IN+, OUT+, and OUT-    Two general purpose inputs (GPI) and two general purpose outputs (GPO) for synchronizing Joulescope captures with your target device and other equipment    Programmable operational/off selection for power cycling the target device and measuring inrush currents    USB 2.0 high-speed host connectivity with full-rate data streaming    Host software support for MicrosoftÃÂÃÂ® WindowsÃÂÃÂ®, AppleÃÂÃÂ® MacÃÂÃÂ® OS XÃÂÃÂ® and LinuxÃÂÃÂ®    Host software provides real-time graphs of current, voltage, and power over time    Host software is open source and available on github    Swappable front panel with open source designs on github    Firmware upgradable   You can find the latest specifications in the Joulescope User's Guide which you can download from  joulescope.com .  Why is Joulescope Different?   Compared to a multimeter : The classic low-cost approach to estimating total energy consumption is to use a normal multimeter. ÃÂÃÂ If the voltage is changing, you need two multimeters, but if the voltage is constant, you just need one multimeter to measure current. ÃÂÃÂ Since the device has multiple power states, you need to put the device into each state and measure the current for that state. ÃÂÃÂ You then need a model of how long the device is in each state. ÃÂÃÂ You multiply the state currents times their duration and add them all together to estimate total energy. ÃÂÃÂ This approach is very tedious and error-prone. ÃÂÃÂ What happens if you accidentally change something that drastically effects energy consumption while using this method? ÃÂÃÂ Are you performing this energy test every day? ÃÂÃÂ Hardly. ÃÂÃÂ You usually don't find out for weeks or even months which is really bad for the project.   Compared to an oscilloscope:  Another classic approach is to use an oscilloscope with a shunt resistor. ÃÂÃÂ This approach is limited to the oscilloscope's dynamic range, often just 10 or 12 bits, which is not sufficient for modern devices. ÃÂÃÂ Let's take an example device that has 1 A active current and 1 ÃÂÃÂµA sleep current. ÃÂÃÂ To measure sleep current to 5% accuracy requires 24-bits of dynamic range, way more than any oscilloscope. ÃÂÃÂ Joulescope provides the equivalent of approximately 32-bits of dynamic range! ÃÂÃÂ The oscilloscope approach also requires you to measure the voltage across the shunt resistor, and you often need to float your circuit, float your scope, or use a differential probe. ÃÂÃÂ Each option has disadvantages. ÃÂÃÂ Another option, customized current probes, are expensive and still lack the dynamic range.ÃÂÃÂ    Compared to customized equipment:  The major test vendors have expensive equipment that allow accurate measurement under these conditions. ÃÂÃÂ This equipment is great, but is priced closer to a new car than a multimeter. ÃÂÃÂ Even if it fits into your budget, it is usually shared by the team. ÃÂÃÂ If equipment is not convenient, developers rarely use it. ÃÂÃÂ Developers need quick, accurate and cost-effective energy consumption measurements so that they have immediate feedback on the consequences of their changes.  The Backstory  At multiple times during his career, Matt Liberty, the creator of Joulescope, has been frustrated trying to measure the energy consumption of products. ÃÂÃÂ With the increase in IoT, AIoT and wearables products, accurately measuring energy consumption is even more critical. ÃÂÃÂ Nearly two years ago, Matt got fed up and decided to solve the problem. ÃÂÃÂ Matt set out to democratize energy measurement by developing an instrument with a comparable cost to a multimeter but with the capabilities of the customized high end equipment. ÃÂÃÂ   The initial target was to support up to +12V systems and +3.8V lithium-ion batteries with currents up to 2A and sleep currents down to 1 ÃÂÃÂ¼A. ÃÂÃÂ In order to measuring meaningful changes of 1 ÃÂÃÂ¼A sleep currents, an accuracy of at least 100 nA was needed. ÃÂÃÂ Matt knew that this high dynamic range would be an engineering challenge.  We developed Joulescope using an iterative approach so that we could quickly refine the design. ÃÂÃÂ The conflicting goals of low cost and high precision required careful engineering. ÃÂÃÂ Over the course of development, we built 17 different prototype boards.     Prototypes!  The many iterations that refined Joulescope.    Each prototype allowed us to improve the Joulescope design and to develop a cost-effective yet accurate way to measure this wide range of currents. ÃÂÃÂ Due to the demanding and cutting edge requirements, we built even more test boards to fully characterize Joulescope's performance, especially the 250 kHz bandwidth and transient response. ÃÂÃÂ      Some custom test boards that supported Joulescope development    In January, we completed the Joulescope beta build of 25 units. ÃÂÃÂ This build allowed us to test the manufacturing process and get Joulescope into the hands of reviewers and a few eager engineers.ÃÂÃÂ      Joulescope beta build: 25 units    After nearly two years of work, we now have a product that is easy-to-use, affordable and exceeds our original performance goals. ÃÂÃÂ   Rewards  Joulescope is now ready to help you build more energy efficient products. ÃÂÃÂ We need your support to raise money for the Joulescope manufacturing run.       The ""Kickstarter Special"" Joulescope reward includes a Joulescope for $499 USD, a $300 discount from the retail price. ÃÂÃÂ Each Joulescope reward includes the Joulescope instrument, a 6' USB cable and a sticker.  Joulescope is designed to empower every member of the development team to improve energy consumption. ÃÂÃÂ We are offering three different team rewards that contain multiple Joulescopes. ÃÂÃÂ The ""Team Pack x5"" reward includes 5 Joulescopes at a reduced cost. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ The ""Team Pack x10"" reward includes 10 Joulescopes at a reduced cost.

ÃÂÃÂ        The Team  We have assembled a great team that has the experience and knowledge to successfully manufacture Joulescopes and get them to you.  Matt Liberty is the creator of Joulescope, and also the project lead and engineering lead. Matt is a hardware and software engineering consultant focused on creating high-quality embedded systems. Matt has over 20 years of experience creating and manufacturing products. ÃÂÃÂ Over the last 8 years as a consultant at Jetperch LLC, Matt has developed a number of successful products for a range of companies. ÃÂÃÂ Before Jetperch, Matt was a Director at Hillcrest Labs. ÃÂÃÂ He is also renown for his earlier work on Hillcrest Lab's Freespace motion sensing where he was granted 27 US patents related to motion sensing technologies. ÃÂÃÂ Matt was a speaker and adviser to the Embedded Systems Conference for several years. ÃÂÃÂ Matt is based in Maryland, USA.  Custom Electronic Co. (CEC) is the Joulescope manufacturing partner. ÃÂÃÂ CEC assembles the circuit boards, performs top-level assembly, programs the units, and calibrates each unit. CEC is conveniently located near Jetperch, and works in close collaboration with Jetperch to ensure manufacturing success.  Allied Component Works provides design for manufacturing reviews, feedback and process improvements to ensure that every Joulescope meets our exacting standards.  Joulescope would not be possible without OSH Park, OSH Stencil, PCBWay, MacroFab, Protolabs, Storey Store Media, McMaster-Carr, Mouser, and Digikey. ÃÂÃÂ StickerMule makes our spiffy stickers.      Risks and challenges  We have a skilled and dedicated team that has successfully brought products to market.  All hardware products, including Joulescope, have risk going into manufacturing.  We have worked diligently to minimize these risks so that we get your Joulescope to you on time.  Development: The Joulescope shipping box and packaging still needs to be developed.  This often neglected step delays many products.  We have identified a partner and have started this process. We plan on keeping packaging simple to reduce risk.  Hardware: Joulescope beta units are already being used by actual people in the field, which drastically reduces the engineering risk.  Although unlikely, an issue discovered during beta testing could require additional time to resolve, likely require a PCB respin, and delay manufacturing.    Compliance: We have not yet performed official CE, FCC or USB certification.  Any unexpected issues raised during certification could require additional engineering which would delay manufacturing.    Software: The firmware &amp; FPGA code in Joulescope is fully upgradable in the field.  The host computer software is easily upgradable.  The only potential software issue that would halt production would be in the custom bootloader on the USB microcontroller.  We have already developed and tested this bootloader, so any critical errors are unlikely, but the possibility still exists.  Production: Products may prove to be too difficult, time-consuming, or costly to manufacture.  To reduce this risk, we have already built the beta units with our selected contract manufacturer.  However unlikely, unanticipated manufacturability challenges could arise during the production build which would delay production.  Supply chain: Component shortages, especially for MLCC capacitors, are a global concern now.  Parts shortages and long lead times are common with components going in and out of stock every day.  We have no control over this.  We have designed Joulescope to accept standard components to allow substitutions.  We will place parts on order immediately (and already have ordered a few critical components!), but delays in component availability could delay manufacturing.  Team: We have a small team.  Everyone needs to stay reasonably healthy to keep shipment on schedule!"

We had been married over 15 years and created 2 wonderful children . Though still in love, our sex life had slowed and become less and less regular. This reduced romance in the bedroom played out in our daily lives as we became less connected and generally less capable of handling the challenges of life and a family together. As I reflected on our regularity of intimacy I realized that it wasn't one-sided. Some nights I'd be the instigator and she'd not be feeling it, and other nights the opposite would be true. Rejection is never fun, even from your partner of 15 years - so over time we each began trying less often.Finally, one evening as I lay in bed wondering if she'd be the one to make a move I thought &quot;What if there was a way I could secretly and anonymously convey my interest and ONLY if she had the same interest would both our intentions be known?&quot; As a consumer robotics engineer, I knew that technology could likely present a solution. Not long after, we had a basic functioning prototype that allowed us to test my theory.Sure enough, now that we can act on every chance where we're thinking the same thing, our frequency has increased significantly - and with it the quality of our relationship overall. Having shared our experience with others, it's become clear that our situation is not unique. In fact, as we researched the issue further, we found that the majority of couples are affected by some level of &quot;desire disparity&quot; in their sexual relationship. During her work as a manager at a marriage and family counseling practice , Jenn sees families every day who suffer from a decline in romance. In many cases, these declines build to a level beyond repair and families split. It is our belief that this technology has the potential to prevent this decline before it reaches a level of breaking apart families. If there is any chance that others can experience the same improvements in their relationship that we have enjoyed, then we must try and share this invention with the world.",1.0,2018-11-18 08:56:07 -0500,Backed 3 projects,"Cleveland, OH",22,"ÃÂÃÂ You're in love, but you don't always know when your partner is in the mood for romance... and sometimes you get shot down.

By gently applying (without pressure) the emulsion contained in the wet wipes to the surface to be cleaned, dust and dirt particles are first loosened and coated with a protective layer. At the same time, the surface is protected by the special ingredients of the emulsion. A double layer is created between the surface and the dirt. The dirt is then gently removed with a specially designed microfibre cloth. By polishing the surfaces (with the clean side of the microfibre cloth) you leave your vehicle looking perfectly shiny.

He gives her a name - her name is Emmy. To give her the proper care, he gets countless care products. The cost and the result frustrate him. In a conversation with the experienced youngtimer &amp; motorcycle enthusiast, Dustin Weidenhiller, he makes his displeasure air.ÃÂÃÂ   The experienced screwdriver shares his opinion and the two make the identified problem theirs. It is the birth of the GentleMonkeys. That same year, with a chemical cleaning company specializing in car cleaning, they began to develop large wet wipes designed to clean, care for, and seal all smooth surfaces on vehicles. They put everything on a map to realize their vision of sustainable, simple and comprehensive vehicle care.ÃÂÃÂ         English is not our native language, we had no experience in front of the camera and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re certainly not models.... so have fun watching some outtakes ;-)          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Durch das sanfte Auftragen (ohne Druck) der Emulsion der FeuchttÃÂÃÂ¼cher auf die zu reinigende OberflÃÂÃÂ¤che werden Staub- und Schmutzpartikel zunÃÂÃÂ¤chst gelÃÂÃÂ¶st und mit einer Schutzschicht ummantelt.ÃÂÃÂ   Zugleich wird die zu reinigende OberflÃÂÃÂ¤che durch spezielle Inhalte der Emulsion geschÃÂÃÂ¼tzt. Es entsteht eine doppelte HÃÂÃÂ¼lle zwischen OberflÃÂÃÂ¤che und Schmutz. AnschlieÃÂ<U+009F>end wird der Schmutz schonend mit dem speziell abgestimmten Mikrofasertuch beseitigt.ÃÂÃÂ Mit dem Aufpolieren der FlÃÂÃÂ¤chen (mit der sauberen Seite des Mikrofastertuches) verleihst Du dem Fahrzeug enormen Glanz.ÃÂÃÂ   Die spezielle Rezeptur der GentleWipes hinterlÃÂÃÂ¤sst dabei eine hauchdÃÂÃÂ¼nne Wachsschicht, die In Verbindung mit Sauerstoff aushÃÂÃÂ¤rtet und die OberflÃÂÃÂ¤che vor UmwelteinflÃÂÃÂ¼ssen wie UV-Strahlen, Wasser o.ÃÂÃÂ¤.ÃÂÃÂ schÃÂÃÂ¼tzt. ÃÂÃÂ         Animation der Wirkungsweise:ÃÂÃÂ       Die Funktionsweise      Die revolutionÃÂÃÂ¤re GentleSeal (GM18) Technologie:             Die von uns entwickelte TrÃÂÃÂ¤nkflÃÂÃÂ¼ssigkeit der Gentlewipes enthÃÂÃÂ¤lt einen neuartigen Schmutzentferner, der ÃÂ<U+0096>l, Teer, Fett, Bremsstaub, Insekten und andere Verschmutzungen (auch hartnÃÂÃÂ¤ckigste) ohne RÃÂÃÂ¼ckstÃÂÃÂ¤nde entfernt. Die Gentlewipes kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen auf fast allen OberflÃÂÃÂ¤chen innen und aussen am Fahrzeug verwendet werden.ÃÂÃÂ   Die revolutionÃÂÃÂ¤re Gentleseal (GM18) -Technologie fÃÂÃÂ¼llt vorhandene Mikrokratzer bei jeder Anwendung auf und die OberflÃÂÃÂ¤che wird mit einem speziellen Hochglanz- und Versiegelungseffekt geschÃÂÃÂ¼tzt.                 Durchschnittlich werden 160 Liter frisches Wasser zur Reinigung eines Fahrzeugs verwendet. Pro FahrzeugwÃÂÃÂ¤sche verwendet GentleWipes nur 100 bis 250 ml der proprietÃÂÃÂ¤ren TrÃÂÃÂ¤nkflÃÂÃÂ¼ssigkeit.  Der durchschnittliche Pro-Kopf-Verbrauch in Europa liegt zwischen 120 und 270 Litern Frischwasser pro Tag. Ein erheblicher Teil dieses Wasserverbrauchs wird durch die Fahrzeugpflege verschwendet.  160 Liter Wasser entsprechen:       Neben der Einsparung von Wasser durch die Verwendung von GentleWipes zur Fahrzeugreinigung haben wir besonderes Augenmerk auf Nachhaltigkeit gelegt:  Alle chemischen Komponenten der ImprÃÂÃÂ¤gnierflÃÂÃÂ¼ssigkeit von GentleWipes sind europaweit nach   Reach   zertifiziert. Die GentleWipes bestehen aus reiner Viskose, einer Naturfaser, die zu 100% biologisch abbaubar ist. Die Spenderdosen bestehen aus PU und sind nachfÃÂÃÂ¼llbar, sodass sie dauerhaft und nachhaltig eingesetzt werden kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen.                   Mit Deiner UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzung wirst auch Du einen grossen Teil zur nachhaltigen Fahrzeugpflege beitragen ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> das ist die Zukunft. Speziell bei den UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzern, die sich fÃÂÃÂ¼r die BlackEdition entscheiden, mÃÂÃÂ¶chten wir uns auf unser Website bedanken. Du wirst ein Teil der Community, die mit Namen und Bild auf unserer Seite als offizielle ""INITIAL SUPPORTER"" genannt werden.ÃÂÃÂ   Hier steht dann auch Dein Name:            Wir haben uns mit einem Spezialisten aus der KFZ-Reinigungsindustrie in Deutschland zusammengetan und mehr als ein Jahr damit verbracht, die GentleWipes zu entwickeln. Wir haben hunderte Kombinationen, Designs und Formeln getestet, bevor wir  die perfekte LÃÂÃÂ¶sung gefunden haben.  Wir sind tausende von Kilometern quer durch ganz Europa gefahren und haben die GentleWipes sechs Monate lang auf ÃÂÃÂ¼ber 30 verschiedenen OberflÃÂÃÂ¤chen ausgiebig getestet, einschlieÃÂ<U+009F>lich Langzeittests sowohl im Innen- als auch im AuÃÂ<U+009F>enbereich von Fahrzeugen.  Zahllose Menschen haben uns ihre  Autos, MotorrÃÂÃÂ¤der und andere Transportmittel fÃÂÃÂ¼r diese Tests zur VerfÃÂÃÂ¼gung gestellt. (Danke dafÃÂÃÂ¼r an all unsere Freunde).  Schlussendlich haben wir dann das Branding, die Internetseite, das Shopsystem ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> also das komplette Look&amp;Feel der Marke aufgebaut.    Einige Momentaufnahmen der letzten 1,5 Jahre:                                 Wir haben die GentleWipes aus unserer Leidenschaft fÃÂÃÂ¼r Fahrzeuge entwickelt und versprechen Euch, dass sie wirklich funktionieren! Sie funktionieren sogar besser, als erwartet. Wir sind bereit fÃÂÃÂ¼r die Serienproduktion, unsere Zulieferer stehen in den StartlÃÂÃÂ¶chern und unsere ProduktionsstÃÂÃÂ¤tte ist bereit - hier brauchen wir Euren Support.   Insbesondere die Mittel dafÃÂÃÂ¼r.  Wenn Du also dieses fantastische Produkt (zu einem vergÃÂÃÂ¼nstigten EinfÃÂÃÂ¼hrungspreis) erhalten willst und ein Teil der Zukunft der nachhaltigen Fahrzeugpflege sein mÃÂÃÂ¶chtest, wÃÂÃÂ¼rden wir uns ÃÂÃÂ¼ber Deine UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzung sehr freuen.   ... und folge uns auf:                                  2017 fÃÂÃÂ¤hrt Gerhard Pletschacher nach 30 Jahren Pause das erste mal wieder Motorrad und verliebt sich im selben Jahr unsterblich in eine Harley Davidson. Er gibt ihr einen Namen ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> sie heiÃÂ<U+009F>t jetzt Emmy. Um ihr die angemessene Pflege angedeihen zu lassen, erwirbt er unzÃÂÃÂ¤hlige Pflegeprodukte. Der Kostenaufwand und das Ergebnis frustrieren ihn. In einem GesprÃÂÃÂ¤ch mit dem erfahrenen Youngtimer- &amp;  Motorrad-Enthusiasten, Dustin Weidenhiller, macht er seinem Unmut Luft.ÃÂÃÂ   Der versierte Schrauber teilt seine Meinung und die beiden machen das erkannte Problem zu ihrem. Es ist die Geburtsstunde der GentleMonkeys. Noch im selben Jahr beginnen sie ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> mit einem auf die KFZ-Reinigung spezialisierten Chemieunternehmen ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> groÃÂ<U+009F>flÃÂÃÂ¤chige NassreinigungstÃÂÃÂ¼cher zu entwickeln, die alle glatten OberflÃÂÃÂ¤chen am Fahrzeug reinigen, pflegen und versiegeln sollen. Sie setzen alles auf eine Karte, um ihre Vision von nachhaltiger, einfacher und umfassender Fahrzeugpflege zu realisieren.ÃÂÃÂ        Englisch ist nicht unsere Muttersprache, wir hatten keine Erfahrung vor der Kamera und wir sind keine Models ... hier ein paar Outtakes der Filmaufnahmen ;-)         You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Developing any new product today involves unexpected challenges which can arise in the course of development and production. We strive to reduce any risk to a minimum and to deliver a high-quality product on time. We currently estimate a production lead time of 5-6 weeks. In the long term, and as we scale up, we plan to significantly shorten this time.  OUR PROMISE TO YOU:  GentleWipes work - even better than expected. Many friends and  car specialists have supported us in testing the wipes as intensively as possible. From bicycles to motorbikes, from modern cars to classic cars ... even on boats, we have tested GentleWipes as extensively as possible and of course had them tested by others.  With your backing we can now present this unique product to the world.  All pictures shown are prototypes; the final product design and packaging may be subject to change.  //// Deutsche Version ////  Zahllose Prototypen wurden entwickelt, evaluiert und getestet - bis wir das perfekte Produkt hatten.

Die Entwicklung eines neuen Produkts ist heute mit unerwarteten Herausforderungen verbunden, die sich im Laufe der Entwicklung und der Produktion ergeben kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen. Wir arbeiten hart, um jedes Risiko auf ein Minimum zu reduzieren und rechtzeitig ein qualitativ hochwertiges Produkt ausliefern zu kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen.

DataBoss software needs   a publisher authentication and certificate    a more professional Installer   Both cost a lot of money. Being a small company, we simply do not have the funds to do so on our own. So we are crowdfunding those developments here on Kickstarter. You help us make a better software, and in exchange you get a huge deal on the software cost!   We are also adding a    new feature    ÃÂÃÂ to DataBoss!  With this version 2.3, ""open in Windows Explorer"" will also automatically open a universal thumbnail viewer. Why is it important? Because your files may not show as thumbnails in Windows Explorer (Olympus/Panasonic RAW; many others..) but they  will  show for you just fine with this new improvement.  New Feature:   a universal thumbnail image viewer for RAW and other file types is needed due to Windows OS not being able to generate those thumbnails   So... how do we  fund  these new improvements/developments of DataBoss?   Enter Kickstarter .

We are always committed to designing and producing the products that meet the requirements of our customers and are popular among the public,allowing our backers to have a fun with tablet in a new way.",1.0,2018-07-08 22:46:41 -0400,Backed 0 projects,"Shenzhen, China",784,"First of all, a big thank you for your support of CHUWI. Last year, the first product in the CHUWI crowdfunding product line ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093>SurBook ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> was introduced on Indiegogo and raised more than one million dollars, as well as receiving critical acclaim as an affordable tablet for business, designed to fit your environment and offer productivity at home or in the office.            Building on that success, the feedback and experience from the project has inspired us to create a brand new UBook for 2019. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ Why we created UBookÃÂÃÂ   From the outset, in order to produce the best tablet that meets users requirements, we randomly selected 2000 SurBook users to summarize any problems they had with SurBook. ÃÂÃÂ HereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s what they told us:ÃÂÃÂ         Data description: ÃÂÃÂ Pursuit of lightweight body    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Nearly half of those questioned were dissatisfied with the weight of SurBook. As such, we realized that as two-in-one products gradually becomes ÃÂÃÂ usersÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> main productivity tool, portable/on-the-go use are the most important factors for users to distinguish between 2-in-1 tablets and traditional notebooks.   Enhance battery life    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ 30% of users think felt that the battery life is not enough. For the businessman who usually works outside the office, ÃÂÃÂ long-lasting batteries are essential and their first consideration. You spoke. We listened.   More storage    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ The data also shows that 25% of users wanted more capacity. Nowadays, either the software and high-resolution images ÃÂÃÂ are getting larger. We know that whether for ÃÂÃÂ loading applications or reading and writing data,the advantages of a large capacity are unparalleled.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Combining the above data with analysis of independent reports into the two-in-one tablet industry, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve come up with most important factors for users looking to buy a new tablet are portability, storage capacity and long battery life.ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Since then, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve redesigned the tablet, focusing on these three points. From prototype design to sample production and performance test, our UBook team has devoted itself to fine detail of developing our latest product, with great enthusiasm, commitment and determination to bring you the best UBook possible.       How we made UBook ÃÂÃÂ    Go beyond tradition, start with portability ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Every design and material decision of the UBook is carefully made by our architects. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ For the material, we chose the latest aviation magnesium alloy and nano molding, which reduces the weight to 760g (1kg with the keyboard). ÃÂÃÂ Through more than 2,000 hours of data research and practical considerations, our engineers tried 30 displays before choosing an 11.6 inch screen, offering the perfect balance between performance and portability. ÃÂÃÂ        WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve adopted a fully-laminated screen which reduces the touch TP layer, thus reducing the weight of the device. Plus, the unique U-shaped bracket design makes the UBook 200g lighter than a traditional bracket. Meanwhile, the lighter and thinner high-density lithium polymer battery is adopted for maximum stamina at the lightest weight. By reducing weight in these three ways, the UBook is our most comfortable device to hold, ever. ÃÂÃÂ         More capacity - never less    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ With up to 1TB storage capacity, UBook is one of the largest capacity two-in-one Windows tablets on the market with over eight times that of ÃÂÃÂ Surface Go's largest storage version. At the same time, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve moved from eMMC storage to an M.2 SSD, blazing more than five times on reading and writing speeds. WhatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s more, thereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s an additional microSD ÃÂÃÂ card slot designed to expand more storage space. ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ But storage is no good without memory. The RAM is the important bridge between the CPU and the outside world, so we wouldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t ever underestimate it. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve upgraded it from 6GB to a mighty 8GB. The more memory, the more data can be read or temporarily stored, and the speed of the device is faster, ensuring fluency between simultaneous operation and switching between multiple programs.        Enhanced battery endurance all aroundÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve found lots of ways to squeeze more battery from the UBook. Firstly, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve optimized the BIOS, pulling up the basic frequency as soon as an application or process is started, to ensure that programs runs smoothly, whilst standby mode and simple tasks run at a lower frequency as the system dynamically adjusts for optimum performance.  Secondly, for the hardware, we strictly chose only hardware that will minimize power consumption, including LPDDR3 ultra-low-power memory and M.2 SSD drawing just 3w power, ensuring low-power output of the device. Plus, the high-density polymer lithium battery has ultra-high conversion efficiency, about 20% higher than traditional batteries. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ                            With UBook,you can work and communicate when and where you need. It fits in the palm of your hand without keyboard.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        Sometimes, you donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t want to lug a heavy laptop with you everywhere you go. UBook ÃÂÃÂ is your best choice when you want something portable and easy to handle.ÃÂÃÂ        Look! What a light tablet! Thanks to its small size and lightweight frame, it can be held with one hand, making it perfect for home, travel, work and everyday tasks.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ                        Outstanding design    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ At only 9mm thickness and weighing a mere 760g, UBook is the best choice for those who are tired of carrying a clunky notebook all day. The advanced aviation magnesium alloy and nano-injected synthetic metal reduces the weight while maintaining the toughness of the outer casing. It is portable and fits easily in your bag. ÃÂÃÂ        Accompanied with the detachable keyboard,UBook is perfect for just about any task.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        UBook has a unique U-shaped adjustable kickstand which can be flipped freely between 0 to 150 degrees for maximum visibility. Compared with the Ipad Pro, it is easier for you to present the screen to your colleagues or friends and frees your hand. And another great bit of design, you will find a hole encircling speaker area on both sides that help the sound flow smoothly.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ  Extremely powerful Intel processorÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  UBook is powered by a IntelÃÂÃÂ® CoreÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢m3-6Y30 fanless processor, an efficient dual-core SoC clocked at 0.9 ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> 2.2 GHz and manufactured using a 14 nm process. Thanks to its extremely low TDP, the CPU is ideal for passively cooled tablets and 2-in-1 devices like UBook. By the way, the fanless design ensures ÃÂÃÂ quiet operation at high speeds without sacrificing powerful cooling.ÃÂÃÂ   Offering up to a 17% improvement in application performance from previous generations of Chuwi tablet, and a 41% increase in media decoding performance, there is no lag, no matter whether you are browsing the web or editing pictures. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        Graphics duties are handled by the Intel HD Graphics 515 GPU which supports DirectX 12 and operates at up to 850 MHz. The video encoder/decoder is powerful enough to handle large bitrate video files and is fast enough for quick video conversion.ÃÂÃÂ         High-definition visual appeal    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ CHUWI UBook adopts an 11.6-inch 1920*1080 full-HD screen,which offers the best balance between portability and comfortable viewing. After testing and matching on different screens, we chose an FHD screen which offers clear vision and yet ÃÂÃÂ can be increased battery stamina by more than 30%. UBookÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s screen is an advanced LCD technology-IPS panel, and with a viewing angle up to 178 degrees, UBook provides uncompromised visuals from wide viewing angles, making it great for sharing. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        UBook pairs with a fully-laminated display. Compared with a traditional non-fully laminated screen, you can intuitively see the difference. For example, fully laminated technology can greatly reduce glare ÃÂÃÂ making your pictures even more transparent and colorful - perfect for indoor and outdoor use. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ         Fast Running    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Featuring a dual-channel 8GB LPDDR3, UBook has twice as much RAM as Surface Pro and iPad Pro, meaning that you can work seamlessly even if you run multiple heavy-resourced software at the same time.   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ In addition, because it boasts dual channel memory, the bandwidth is doubled compared to a standard single channel array. If you are a creator or gamer, dual channel memory is your best choice to improve data processing capabilities and operate fluently. WhatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s more,compared with traditional memory, LPDDDR3 has lower power consumption and greatly extends battery life. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        When it came to Adobe Premier CC suite of tests, you can see that 4GB of memory takes up to 415 seconds, thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s 115 seconds more than 8GB. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ         Maximum capacity  ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ UBook has one of the largest memory in its Windows series. Whether it is 1TB or 128GB, all UBook editions are equipped with M.2 SSDÃÂ¯ÃÂ¼<U+008C>allowing ÃÂÃÂ you to instantly launch apps and providing more space to store all your files, photos and videos. Don't worry about running out of storage , thereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s an extra option to expand with a microSD memory card. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        The SSD is based on the AHCI protocol-based SATA 3.0, which doubles the rate to 6Gb/s compared to the previous generation SATA 2.0, making the theoretical transfer speed up to 600MB / s. ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ         Loads of Interfaces &amp; Cutting Edge Wireless    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ The variety of UBook interfaces is enough for you to connect all your different devices. Despite the slim body, we still made room for two high-speed USB-A interfaces on each side. You can connect to any USB-based peripherals such as printer, USB flash disk and USB Hub. Of course,you can also output high-definition videos to the TV through the micro HDMI interface.ÃÂÃÂ        Wirelessly, thereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s an internal dual-band WiFi module and Bluetooth 4.0. Plus,UBook is able to connect to Gigabit Ethernet over AC networks with transmission speeds of up to 40 MB / s.        Up to 9.5 hours of usage    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Thanks to the 2 ÃÂ<U+0097> 4000mAh high capacity and high-density polymer lithium batteries,UBook is able to provide about 9.5 hours of excellent battery life. In addition, there is Intel's ultra-low-power 4.5W Core-M platform and M.2 SSD with only 3W power, ensuring UBook has enough capacity to power your fun and games.   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ On the other hand, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve also worked hard to ensure the Bios is optimized. We can adjust the main frequency control of hardware more intelligently and dynamically. The combination of software and hardware make UBooks more durable. ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ         Adjustable and backlit keyboard    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ UBookÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s brand new keyboard is tested for over 10 million strokes to ensure long-lasting reliability.The ultra-thin, anti-splash keyboard cover of Ubook is processed with polyurethane nano-coating to create a smooth touch thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s easy to clean. The keyboard layout itself has widened to allow for some much-appreciated spacing between keys, which in turn reduces typing errors and enhances the average typing speed.Every keystroke provides a distinct tactile feedback. An extra-large glass trackpad offers precise control and navigation. Meanwhile, the detachable keyboard can meet the needs of entertainment and work in equal measure, and because its backlit you can work in low light - even in the dark!ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ         1,024 Pressure-level stylus    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ UBook also comes bundled with a ÃÂÃÂ stylus offering 1,024 levels of sensitivity , with virtually no lag.In addition, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve developed unique 'palm suppression' technology, ÃÂÃÂ used to respond to specified areas only when multi-touch is supported - making your writing or drawing more accurate and quicker. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ         Efficient, Professional-Windows 10 OS    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ As a recognized partner of Microsoft, ChuwiÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s UBook operates on the reliable Windows 10 - and not just Windows 10 S Mode, the full Home Edition.

We are a small, private, project-based secondary school located in rural Southwestern Virginia. Here at Springhouse, we are reimagining the purpose and practice of education by fostering the holistic development of youth, young adults, and adults.ÃÂÃÂ   To that end, under the supervision of a boat builder with a background in education, Springhouse teens have converted an old dairy barn into a heated boat shop and begun construction on a 22 foot plywood sailboat of a unique design we're calling the, ""Springhouse Skiff.""ÃÂÃÂ   Every step in boat construction, from lofting and joinery to sailmaking and finish work is being carried out by students, who are continually challenged to learn new skills.ÃÂÃÂ   In May, after initial trials in a local lake, students and staff will take the boat to coastal waters for a four-day excursion where they will learn to sail the boat they built.ÃÂÃÂ   Our Boatshop     This is the boatshop before we got started    Springhouse doesn't have a shop or maker space, so we have had to create one. We have the use of an old dairy barn, but it gets pretty cold here in Southwest Virginia, so the students have built a plastic room inside the barn, which we heat with a wood stove. Humble, but functional. ÃÂÃÂ          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

The Boat     The Springhouse Skiff    The boat we chose to build was our adaptation of a flat bottomed skiff, designed by Phil Bolger. We made it 50% larger and multi masted to accommodate a big crew, all of which want to help sail the boat.ÃÂÃÂ      We just put the flat pieces together into a 3d boat shape!    The Class     Jack explains Bernoulli's Principle to the Class    Back in the classroom, the students at Springhouse are learning math and science in a program we designed as an academic counterpoint to the practical work that is going on in the boatshop.ÃÂÃÂ      Students Lashing Sails onto their Models    Through modeling all aspects of a sailboat, students are learning algebra, geometry, and science.ÃÂÃÂ   Please donate and help us bring this project to completion!

ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ  If we raise $3,500,  that will provide us the funds to build a second boat. ÃÂÃÂ This one may be a slightly smaller, simplified version, but picture a dozen kids on two boats, boiling down the bay on a stiff breeze with bones in their teeth (the boats, not the kids). This is the stuff of dreams. ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  The main challenge is moving forward with the project in a timely fashion, keeping construction on track, while at the same time, taking the time to let students get the most out of their learning. The educational power of making mistakes cannot be overestimated.  Our timeline must provide the necessary slack to allow for these learning opportunities while still keeping us on track for our completion date."

These tubes are big and beautiful, and since they are rather rare and very large, I decided a four digit design would be economical and yet more than adequate for a scrolling text nixie clock.ÃÂÃÂ The clock can also be used without the wifi module, but will not have the scrolling text/date feature.

The pc board for Nixie Clock VIII    This nixie clock is available as a kit you can build yourself, or as a built clock complete except for tubes. There is only one complete assembled clock with tubes currently available, since I haven't been able to obtain any more of these tubes, however if I do I will add another! I still wanted to put this project up to let those of you who have some of these tubes (or hope to obtain some) the chance to try them in my design.     The silkscreen &amp; soldermask layer(s) for Nixie clock VIII pc board.     As always, the design is meant to be both aesthetically pleasing and sturdy. The circuitry is composed of standard size components that are easier to work with and much easier to replace than the small surface mount components. In many cases, the smaller parts like surface mount components are also not suitable for the nixie tube clocks, due to the wattage generated which may destroy these small parts over time. The design is deliberately simplified so only essential components are included, making it possible to place everything on one pc board. The circuitry is controlled using one microcontroller, the PIC18f46K20, which has enough digital I/O pins to control all the drivers and take input from the buttons as well as the WiFi module.           Risks and challenges  One challenge with this design was to adapt the scrolling text to four tubes instead of six, and also to a program for the firmware to drive the high voltage tubes using multiplexed outputs. In previous designs that used nixie tubes I used a high voltage decoder chip, however since the alphanumeric tubes have fourteen segments to drive, a different design had to be created. The microcontroller I chose was suited to the design because it has four ports with more than thirty I/O pins, making it possible to drive each tubes separately and each segment individually."

Sophisticated design  A single piece of paper can be folded into innumerable shapes. In the same way, a single Nozori platform can morph into multiple eurorack modules. Changing modules is as simple as changing jumpers position!  The Nozori concept consist of using the same hardware for multiple modules. This hardware is based on a powerful digital core to allow huge versatility. Potentiometers, inputs or outputs can adapt to many module designs: from standard modules  like VCO, VCF or LFO to outstanding functionality never seen before, you will find lots of uses for your Nozori module in your rack.   Unleash your experimentation process thanks to a Nozori and enjoy any of the pre-programmed modules.      Switching module is very simple!    Implications      The implication of this design are huge:    Experiment : one hardware allows more experimentation since you can try many different modules.     Cost : you do not need to trade your used modules to update your rack.    ÃÂÃÂ  Flexibility : even if your rack evolves, you will always find the perfect module for your nozori platform.     Space saving : since a Nozori can morph into several different modules, a 4 modules rack offers an almost unlimited number of combinations.     Specificity : very specific modules can be developed and customised. You will be able to find features that other manufacturers do not risk producing.      This rack offers 160 000 module combinations!    Available modules  Nozori modules range from basic functionalities to very specific modules. There is currently  20 available modules  for the Nozori 68 hardware, and 20 for the nozori 84. The module list include VCO, VCF, VCA, ADSR, LFO, audio effect, strange CV generator, and a lot's more.        4 of the Nozori 68 modules : a shape morphing VCO, an oscillator based on a loop of slowly evolving random value, a morphing VCF and a Karlpus Strong string resonator module.       4 of the Nozori 84 modules : Loopable ADSR, shape morphing LFO, 4 operator FM sound generator and a stereo waveshaper.       Nozori 68 module list      Nozori 84 module list    Frontplate   Elegant frontplates are available to see control parameters of any specific module.

Reward and add-ons   Nozori are eurorack hardware. They will not work as stand alone synthesizers. You need a rack and an eurorack power supply to use them.      In order to keep cost of a nozori platform as low as possible, reward does not include the expansion pack. Only the nozori 68 or 84 is included. If you wish to get the extension pack, please add 50ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ to your pledge.     This small eurorack setup is composed by 4 nozori, a power suply module and a rack    [Update] Stretch goals   Since this project is now fully funded, I want to take into account the comments found online.   Stretch goal 1 : after 20 pledge for the nozori 68 and nozori 84 bundle, I will propose a different design for the expansion panel : 1 expansion panel for the 2 modules, to gain 2U space. Backers will be able to choose between the initial reward (2 independent 2U expansion panel) or the ""new"" 2U expansion panel  for both modules.  Stretch goal 2 :After 20 pledges for a single nozori and it's expansion pack, I'll propose a single 14U front panel that include the jumpers.  Stretch goal 3 : if the project goes beyond 20 000ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ pledge, I'll propose 2 new modules for the nozori 68 and for the nozori 84, and I'll let peoples vote for the 20 best frontplate to produce.  Stretch goal 4 : if the project goes beyond 30 000ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ pledge, I'll include all 22 modules in the expansion pack.   [Update 2] First Stretch goals reached!  I'm glad to see the first stretch goal reach! I'll have to produce a dual expansion panel. This 2U panel will allow to switch modul of both nozori 68 and nozori 84.   Thanks to all backers!      About me  IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m Cyrille Henry, I live and work in Paris, France.My first synthesizer was an MS-10. Then, I learned electronics in order to build all the others.I conceived my first analogue synthesizer in 1998 and switch to digital synthesis few years latter.  I worked from 2000 to 2004 at ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>La kitchenÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ in Paris as an electronics engineer, developing all kind of custom made solution for dance, theater, musicians and other artists. Since then, IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m a free lance developer, working with electronics, sensors and computers, for real time sounds and images generation.  During the same period, I performed more than a 100 time all around the world with chdh : an audio-visual collective.  I have designed the OCS-2 for my own use. In 2017, I founded the nozoÃÂÃÂ¯d brand to share this work.The success of this first machine did encourage me to conceive the MMO-3.They are both mainly handcrafted, all synthesizers are numbered and signed.  NozoÃÂÃÂ¯d synthesizer had lot's of very good feedback from its user community, including  Jean-Michel Jarre ,  Richard Devine , and  Bogdan Raczynski .   I worked for more than 1 year on the Nozori concept to propose a perfect solution for eurorack enthusiast.

I will declare everything accurately in the shipping documentation.  More informations   More informations can be found on   nozoÃÂÃÂ¯d website         Risks and challenges  I build hardware synthesisers for my own use during the last 20 years. I've recently develop and build 2 synths that I sell trough nozoÃÂÃÂ¯d online shop so I control all aspects of hardware fabrication and distribution. The nozori concept have been prototyped during the last year.  A small batch have been produced for real life test with professionals musicians. The firmware is 99% finished: It is stable, bugs are removed as soon as they are noticed in order to provide a bug free experience at the end of this funding campaign. I have designed the nozori to use standard electronic component in order to reduce the risk of out of stock components. But the unexpected can  always happen. The worst case scenario is being late in the delivery."

This is a big one! ÃÂÃÂ My  30th  Kickstarter campaign! ÃÂÃÂ I'd like to introduce you to the (Production Ready)  Arduino E-Z COMMS Shield!        After my last campaign, I wanted to create a simple and fun project. ÃÂÃÂ One that didn't have too many accessories, and one that was plug-and-play. ÃÂÃÂ This shield has a build in LCD with controllable back-light, two on-board indicator LEDs (Green abd red), and an audio output jack function that borrows from my LITTLE BUDDY TALKER Kickstarter campaign. ÃÂÃÂ You'll be able to choose between one of two audio chips that can be talked to easily with code. ÃÂÃÂ Make your projects speak!   Choose between the original LITTLE BUDDY TALKER Library , which includes time, numbers, dates, months, math functions, units of measurement, and SO much more (256 words total).

ÃÂÃÂ    Hear the audio bites on the alphabet chip:                             There are wonderful LITTLE BUDDY TALKER libraries out there that were created by members of the Kickstartarter community. ÃÂÃÂ One of the most popular is one created by the wonderful  LeRoy Miller . ÃÂÃÂ Here's a link (This library is completely compatible with this shield): ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ  LBT Library ÃÂÃÂ        Accessories:  Thankfully the only accessory offered with this campaign is a simple one. ÃÂÃÂ Many reward tiers include a standard male-to-male stereo cable, which is used to interface the shield with an audio amplifier/stereo system audio input line. ÃÂÃÂ Simply take one end of this stereo cable, and insert it into the audio output jack. ÃÂÃÂ The other end of the cable connects to the stereo input of any stereo system. ÃÂÃÂ You can use battery powered dollar store mini-stereos, or you can use a Bose player, or computer speakers, etc. ÃÂÃÂ It's that simple!       The LCD Backlight!  The neat thing about this shield is that you can turn the LCD backlight off with ease. ÃÂÃÂ You can turn it on and off with software, or you can force the backlight on by shorting a 2-pin header under the LCD with a jumper. ÃÂÃÂ This frees up the GPIO that controls the backlight with software. ÃÂÃÂ As you can see from the below diagram, if you unscrew and remove the LCD, you can place an included jumper over the 2-pin header to force the LCD on. ÃÂÃÂ Remove this jumper to make the LCD backlight software controlled.        Commented Code Samples &amp; Video Manual:   I always provide video manuals for my hardware. ÃÂÃÂ I personally learn more quickly when watching someone else work with hardware directly. ÃÂÃÂ This is why a detailed video manual will be provided by the end of this campaign. ÃÂÃÂ Also, fully commented pieces of sample code will be provided. ÃÂÃÂ Said sample code will show you how to easily make this shield talk, how to initialise the LCD, how to make the LCD display information, turn the backlight on and off, and of course, how to control the red and green LEDs.  ÃÂÃÂ All of this information will be available to you here on the custom project page!: ÃÂÃÂ    E-Z Shield Project Page! ÃÂÃÂ    The Assembly Video:                             Some reward tiers include DIY kit versions of this shield. ÃÂÃÂ For those of you who are interested in soldering a shield up from scratch, I've created this assembly video for you. ÃÂÃÂ It is detailed, and easy to follow along with!   ACCESSIBLE PINS:   All GPIO pins, analog pins, and power supply pins are accessible. ÃÂÃÂ There are an additional 6x DC ground pins to connect to, along with 3x extra 3.3v and 3x 5v pins to connect to. ÃÂÃÂ This is so that you can easily interface your shield and UN) with external hardware. ÃÂÃÂ The below diagram shows you everything!        Reward Tiers:   I've kept rewards simple this time around. ÃÂÃÂ That said, if you want to create your own specific reward tier - one that suits you specifically, please feel free to contact me. ÃÂÃÂ I'll happily create a custom reward tier that accommodates your specific hardware needs. ÃÂÃÂ Seriously. ÃÂÃÂ Just drop me a line =D  Why Kickstarter?  As mentioned above, this is my 30th Kickstarter campaign, which is hard for me to believe. Time flies. ÃÂÃÂ I've been so fortunate to have had the support that Kickstarter, and the Kickstarter community has provided me. ÃÂÃÂ There have been people who have pledged towards every single campaign of mine since the beginning. ÃÂÃÂ Without this community, most of my circuit ideas would never come to fruition. ÃÂÃÂ I love being able to design and provide unique electronic projects to the DIY electronics community. ÃÂÃÂ The funds from th is campaign will go towards creating a large amount of wave soldered shields, and component bundles, so that I can eventually put this shield up for sale on my website. ÃÂÃÂ Thanks for 30x projects, Kickstarter!       Production Schedule:  This is a 30-day campaign, which means that all components and assemblies will be ordered  two weeks  after this campaign begins (assuming that it looks like the project will be funded). ÃÂÃÂ At this time you will be updated with my progress. ÃÂÃÂ With the assembly video completed already, I will then start on the video manual and commented code samples. ÃÂÃÂ   It is expected that all hardware will be in house  by the time this campaign ends, which is by the 30-day mark.  ÃÂÃÂ At this point in time, all code samples should be commented and available ÃÂÃÂ in the project page linked above, along with the video manual and assembly video.   All rewards should be shipped out no later than two weeks after this campaign ends.  ÃÂÃÂ I pride myself on having been able to ship rewards early for the majority of my Kickstarter campaigns. ÃÂÃÂ This is the goal for this shield campaign. ÃÂÃÂ After all, this is my 30th Kickstarter campaign =D  ÃÂÃÂ If you have never pledged towards any of my past campaigns, then please know that I post many project updates, I care about your feedback, and I ALWAYS strive to ship on time or early. ÃÂÃÂ Thank you for considering a pledge towards my 30th Kickstarter campaign. ÃÂÃÂ I won't let you down!    Sincerely,    Patrick Mitchell       Risks and challenges  There are next to no risks with this campaign.  All of my previous campaigns have seen reward shipments shipped on time or early, and this campaign is no different.  There is only one shield and one accessory associated with this campaign.  It is a relatively simple and small project.  My relationships with my assembler and component sources are solid.  I've used the same sources for all of my campaigns.  If you have any worries, general concerns, or questions, I'm always happy to answer any questions that you might have directly.  Just drop me a line, and I'll answer promptly.

You can play with her for hours without even opening a laptop.ÃÂÃÂ        Interactive Step-By-Step TutorialsÃÂÃÂ   Teachers and students donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t need a technical background to follow her interactive tutorials. The block-based challenges can be used by anyone without prior programming experience. ZÃÂÃÂ¼mi evolves as you learn and interacts with you along the way with friendly encouragement.            ZÃÂÃÂ¼mi is meant to bring learning about AI to everyone, so she features many affordable technologies familiar to the open-source community. SheÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a tiny self-driving car that wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t break the bank.                 Our team includes passionate engineers, educators, designers and entrepreneurs. The core members include ...ÃÂÃÂ        The Robolink team       Our team based in in Seoul, Korea    We created ZÃÂÃÂ¼mi to make learning about AI more engaging and accessible for everyone.ÃÂÃÂ   AI is the new frontier for human interaction with technology. It's estimated by the McKinsey Global Institute that 70% of companies could be using some form of AI by 2030. It's important for children and even adults to learn about how AI works, and how it can benefit the productivity of our workforce.ÃÂÃÂ   Today, big companies across the globe are researching and funding autonomous driving and AI, but there are hardly  any  resources for learning. Robolink wants to change that, and provide a way for everyone to engage with the future.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ                                              This project is promoted by    Jellop   , the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 600+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.       Risks and challenges  Most of the risks and challenges are behind us. We have completed two successful Kickstarter projects (Rokit Smart and CoDrone). Our team of experienced robotics engineers poured their lives into designing this kit. Our kit has been tested by  users in California and Korea. Throughout the testing phase, we worked to perfect the kit based on the feedback of the users. These users had a blast working with our prototypes and were able to create some absolutely incredible machines. And now, ZÃÂÃÂ¼mi is ready for you. It's for people of all ages and all it's going to take is your support.  At this point, there is just one hurdle left: production. Many of the parts in this kit were custom-designed by our engineers. We have very exacting standards, so creating the molds and manufacturing the components can be very expensive. Thankfully, we have identified some top-tier factory partners who can produce our kits with a very quick turnaround time.  In order to bring the cost down to an affordable amount, we have to order at least 1,000 kits from the manufacturer. To get there, we are counting on you. Give $99 right now and we will put you on the list to be one of the first to receive a ZÃÂÃÂ¼mi so you can start on your own adventure in a self-driving car and AI!"

Some of these books contained so many terminologies and unnecessarily long passages. So, it took us extremely long just to understand what the author was trying to say.ÃÂÃÂ      An illustration showing the nightmare of beginners learning how to program    Whenever we read these books, we really felt like giving up halfway.  At first, we thought that we just werenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t that smart.ÃÂÃÂ   But after talking to other developers, we realized that most of us had faced the same issue when we were just starting out.ÃÂÃÂ        HmmÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦ could it be that programming was reserved for the SUPER SMART people?  Nah, it couldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t be. Some of these developers we were talking to held top positions at the leading technology companies in the world.ÃÂÃÂ   Or could it be that the authors and lecturers just werenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t that great at teaching?  Maybe. But we werenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t really sure.ÃÂÃÂ   So, we looked into it.  We began asking ourselves what were the terrible experiences we had when learning how to program and what could be done better.ÃÂÃÂ   This was what we found.  Problems in existing books and courses  Most  authors and course creators arenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t succinct in their books or courses .ÃÂÃÂ   This meant that as students, we had to spend hours just to learn a few concepts.ÃÂÃÂ   And for many of us, who are either working or studying, it takes EXTREME dedication to do that each day after a long day at work or school. This explains why  most of us give up within the first few days .  A lot of  video tutorials do not have accompanying notes .ÃÂÃÂ   So, if we wanted to refer to something in the course, we had to spend a long time rewinding and rewatching the videos.  Often,  video courses do not have a preview for us to look at. ÃÂÃÂ   This meant that when we are looking to learn a new course, itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s based on recommendations from other users or a friend or sometimes even based on our gut instinct. And that might not always work out. But since  most courses donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t have any refund policies , if we were to buy a course that we donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t like, we are pretty much stuck with it.  How many times have you read through an entire book or watched a course, thinking you understood everything, but when you couldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t even recall the concepts in the last chapter when someone asked you about it?  We know we have. Countless times.ÃÂÃÂ   And thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s because studies have shown that  just reading or watching something, even multiple times, do not improve long-term retention .ÃÂÃÂ   Lastly, for most of us learning from books and online courses, t here wasnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t anyone we could ask if we didnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t understand something .ÃÂÃÂ    And we wanted to change all that.   Why Python?  First, we had to decide on a programming language to teach. After much consideration, we decided to go with Python.ÃÂÃÂ   Why Python?  Because  Python is much easier to get started and master  compared to languages like C++ or C.   Python is also used extensively in Data Analysis, Machine Learning and AI  - areas that are growing at an astonishing pace. This explains why  Python developers are one of the most sought after today and are one of the best-paid software engineers, earning over $100,000 annually!   There are literally thousands of job posts that go unanswered because there is a shortage of skilled Python developers. So, we believe that the  future for skilled Python developers is bright and secured.   And even if you donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t go into these areas,  you can use Python for other purposes like building Desktop Apps.ÃÂÃÂ    Did you know that DropboxÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s desktop app was built using Python?  In short, Python is like the  Swiss army knife of programming languages . You can use it even if you donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t work as a software engineer or a scientist. For example, if you are an entrepreneur or a marketer, you can use Python to analyze your data, and make data driven decisions which would  give you the edge over your competitors .ÃÂÃÂ   Course Syllabus   Getting Started ÃÂÃÂ    Installing Python    Code Editors    Data Types, Variables and OperatorsÃÂÃÂ     print() Function    Comments    Variables    Naming Variables    Mutable and Immutable Types    Strings    Concatenating Strings    Math Expression    Collecting Users' Input    Converting Strings and Numbers    Changing Case in Strings    Escape Sequences    Conditionals and Loops    Logic    Boolean    if statement    else statement    elif statement    Testing sets of Conditions    Nesting statements    For Loops    While loopsÃÂÃÂ     Lists and Tuples    Creating a List    Adding and changing elements in Lists    Slicing Lists    Deleting and removing elements from lists    Popping Elements from Lists    Creating a tupleÃÂÃÂ     Dictionaries    Creating a DictionaryÃÂÃÂ     Adding and Changing Items    Removing Items    Looping through Dictionaries    Creating a List of Dictionaries    Creating a Dictionary that Contains List    Getting Information from a Dictionary that Contains Lists    Creating a Dictionary that Contains a Dictionary    Getting Information from a Dictionary that Contains a DictionaryÃÂÃÂ     Functions    Creating a FunctionÃÂÃÂ     Passing Information    Assigning Value to a Parameter    Mix Positional and Keyword Arguments    Deal with Unknown Number of Arguments    Pass Information Back from Functions    Using Functions as Variables    Functions within Functions    Local and Global Variables    Classes    Creating Classes    Instance    Getting information form instances    Building functions into classes    Coding a method    Change an attributeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s value    Files    CSV files    Accessing Information from CSV Files    Write Information into CSV files    Appending Rows in CSV files    JSON filesÃÂÃÂ     What's included in the course?   When we were deciding on what to include in the course,  we wanted to address the problems that we faced when we were learning Python .  So hereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s what you get when you order the course today:  First, you  get 80 percent off  the retail price of $199.95 when you purchase the course at presale. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a  savings of $160 !  Next, we have  over 70 HD Video Lessons in this course .  Each of our lessons are short, mostly less than 3 minutes, and really easy to digest.ÃÂÃÂ    We understand that a lot of us are busy professionals and do not have hours each day to learn something, so we wanted to ensure that even if you only have a few minutes every day, you can still learn something from the course. ÃÂÃÂ    In fact, if you can only spare 10 minutes each day, you can pretty much finish watching the videos in less than three weeks.ÃÂÃÂ    Also, we  transcribed our videos into downloadable PDFs  so you can easily refer to them.  We also  included quizzes and coding practices at the end of most of our video lessons to test your understanding and reinforces the concepts that you just learnt. ÃÂÃÂ   In this way, you would  remember what you just learned longer , and you also  become more confident and better at coding as you progress in the course .   We also made some of the video lessons and the content to be covered in the course available , so you can check them out below to see if the course is what you are looking for.ÃÂÃÂ   Plus, we have a  30 days money-back guarantee , so in the unlikely event that you are not happy with the course, we would refund you the money within 30 days of the course release date.ÃÂÃÂ   And lastly,  we have also made ourselves available for you to talk to . We always dreamt of having someone we could talked to or ask when we were learning Python. And maybe you do too.ÃÂÃÂ   So, if you have any questions or stuck at some part in the course, you can send an email to us and we would be happy to help you out.  Why start a Kickstarter?  We wanted to gauge the interest for the course before we released the course.ÃÂÃÂ   We also wanted to get users' feedback before we released our course.  We want YOU to be part of the process.   We also needed additional funds for hosting our websites, administrative costs and creating the content.ÃÂÃÂ   So, we decided to have a kickstarter for these purposes and it's also an opportunity to give early supporters an exclusive discount for their support. It's a win-win situation for us.  When will the course be released?   The course would be out on mid-February to end-February onwards.  Our supporters would receive an email informing them that the course is available once the course is released.  Who is this course meant for?  This course is built for learning the basics of Python and meant for non-programmers and programmers in other languages to learn the basics of Python.      Risks and challenges  We don't just want to make the course good. We want to make it great. But sometimes creating something awesome takes a longer time than what we expect. And the same goes for this course. We might take slightly longer than the proposed dates just to make the course better for you. We hope you understand if that situation arises."

It detects the motion of the suspension and other dynamic parameters of the MTB while riding. It allows visualizing the movement of the suspension, in order to base the setting on quantitative information instead of feelings.  BYB Telemetry connects wirelessly to an app or an advanced visualization software. It tells you how to turn the knobs of your suspension to provide you with the perfect suspension set-up, according to your needs and the track characteristic.   BYB Telemetry is developed in the racing environment and it's similar to the technology used in the downhill UCI World Cup from the factory teams. Nevertheless, it has a user-friendly and straightforward interface, aiming to make the  best personalized suspension set-up  accessible to everyone!                       Suspension technology has drastically evolved in the last years, reaching an incredibly high standard of quality and performance, but also complication level. We all spent hours and hours chasing the optimal tuning. With more tuning parameter available on every suspension system, finding a proper suspension set-up is not a straightforward operation.ÃÂÃÂ   Every rider would like to have a perfectly balanced and smooth bike on a rough or technical section.ÃÂÃÂ In fact, an optimal set-up can make the difference concerning chronometric feedback and fatigue. This is true for the professional but also for the amateurs riders.  With BYB Telemetry we want to deliver you the best possible setting of your suspension, accordingly to your needs and the features of the track.   These are the benefits that you will get when you  use data instead of feelings:        An optimal suspension set-up will drastically change the way you ride your bike and the approach to different tracks. With BYB Telemetry every rider will be able to get the best out of his/her bike!       BYB Telemetry is composedÃÂÃÂ by a set of professional motorsport sensors, a data acquisition unit and a set of universal fixing mounts.ÃÂÃÂ        The  electronic acquisition unit  is the heart of the system. It's entirely made in Italy. It can be mounted on every handlebar, with diameter of 35 or 31.8mm, thanks to the specifically designed clamps included in the kit.ÃÂÃÂ   Its main features are:       The  top level motorsport sensors  are the same sensors that are used in the UCI World Cup from the factory teams [ link ]. They directly measure the travel of fork and shock absorber with high accuracy.  The  mountings  elements for the sensor are 3D printed. A flexible material and different fixing layouts are provided in order to guarantee the compatibility with your suspension fork and shock.          This is the kit that you will receive at home         Thanks to a set of universal supports, BYB Telemetry can be easily  installed on every bike: ÃÂÃÂ downhill, enduro, cross country and e-bike.     Which bike will you choose today?    You can use BYB Telemetry at a downhill race on the weekend and then install it in five minutes on your e-bike for a lunch ride with your riding mates.ÃÂÃÂ      BYB Telemetry fits on every MTB         The sensors can be installed in two different configurations, using the same supports. BYB Telemetry can be mounted on any fork withÃÂÃÂ  maximum travel of 203 mm (8"") .ÃÂÃÂ      Universal fork mounts         The rear sensor can be installed on every type of shock absorber, both air and spring based. Thanks to our universal support it can fit in the 99% of the frames. If it doesn't, we will design a pair of ad-hoc supports for your bike.ÃÂÃÂ The standard sensor has a  maximum travel range of 76mm (3"") .ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ On request, we can provide a longer sensor for travel ranges up to 102mm (4"").     Universal shock mounts               The weight of the system, below  500 g  ( 1.1 lbs ), and its dimensions allow you to keep the freedom to move on your bicycle unaltered. The sensor does not interfere with the motion of the suspension, neither with the rider movement.          Data analyzed by your smartphone or PC    BYB Telemetry communicates via  Wi-Fi  with your PC and smartphone.ÃÂÃÂ   An  advanced visualization software  for PC is provided for a precise and detailed analysis. It is thought mostly for professional, experienced riders and suspensionists.  Also, an  Android/iOS app  for the  automated setting   of the suspension ÃÂÃÂ is provided. It analyzes your ride and it tells you how to tune the adjustments to find the best set-up.  If you don't want to bring your smartphone on the trails, no worries. BYB Telemetry has an internal storage and you can analyze the runs anytime you want from your PC or smartphone.       BYB Telemetry provides two differents mode of use, in order to satisfy every rider needs:  1)  Basic setting . It allows you to reach a basic and flexible configurationÃÂÃÂ adaptable to the personal characteristics of the rider and most common trails.  2)  Track specific setting . It allows you to specifically tune the suspension in order to obtain the best performance on a specific track.  Both the basic and track specific setting allow you to select the proper  riding-style . It can be aggressive, comfort or basic.            BYB Telemetry has been designed to be  fast to install  and  easy-to-use .ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  Here are the steps to use BYB Telemetry:   1.  Install the universal support on your fork and shock.       ÃÂÃÂ  2.  Install both sensors on the respective mountings. Make sure to have enough travel of the sensors, to be the same (or higher) of the one of your suspension.        3.  Install the acquisition box on the handlebar and connect the cables coming from the sensors.        4.  No calibration is needed. Everything is ready. Press the button and...        ÃÂÃÂ 5.   RIDE!        ÃÂÃÂ  6.ÃÂÃÂ  Check the data on your laptop or smartphone and apply the adjustments to your suspension.        7.  Reiterate the steps from  4. ÃÂÃÂ and enjoy your perfectly balanced bike.  Automated suspension setting:       The automated suspension setting app allows you to find the best suspension set-up for you and your bike. Connect to your BYB Telemetry kit through our application, select the type of bike you are using and the setting mode (basic or track specific).ÃÂÃÂ   By selecting  basic setting, ÃÂÃÂ BYB Telemetry will analyze all the rides and will tell you the adjustment that needs to be made in order to tune the suspension. You can decide if your riding style is comfort, balanced or aggressive.  By selecting  track specific setting, ÃÂÃÂ BYB Telemetry will analyze the rides on a particular track, telling you the adjustments needed for reaching the best performance on that single track.  Visualization software:       The advanced analysis software allows you to visualize all the data acquired by BYB Telemetry, such as front and rear travel, GPS position, speed and the shocks at the handlebar.   By connecting your laptop via Wi-Fi with BYB Telemetry, you will automatically have access to all the saved runs. For example, you can visualize the percentage of travel that you used inside a particular section of the track, compare different runs by superimposing them and analyze how much the bike is ""nervous"" by looking at the shocks at the handlebar. The access to all these data will allow you to investigate how the bike responds, how stable it is and find a compromise between different set-up. All this will make you able to increase your overall performances.         You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

It detects the critical behaviour related to an incorrect suspension setting, such as:   Bouncing suspension (not enough damping)  Packing down (rebound too slow)ÃÂÃÂ   Bottoming outÃÂÃÂ   Incorrect SAG (static and dynamic)ÃÂÃÂ   Not using the whole travel of the suspensionÃÂÃÂ   Wrong balance between front and rear suspension  Critical peaks of acceleration at the handlebar   All these events are highlighted on the PC software, and the user can investigate them.You will be able to see when the bike bottoms out after that particular jump or when the fork is packing down in the braking-bumps before a corner. You will know precisely where and when it happens. You can decide to use the adjustment proposed from the software or decide to tune your suspension according to your expertise.ÃÂÃÂ   Furthermore, BYB Telemetry provides you with a report of useful statistical information about the ride, such as:   Average use of suspension(%)ÃÂÃÂ   Compression peaks (over 90 %)  Dynamic sagÃÂÃÂ   Static sagÃÂÃÂ   Number of jumpsÃÂÃÂ   Balance between fork and shockÃÂÃÂ   Number of acceleration peaks  Max and average compression/rebound speed   In the track specific mode, BYB Telemetry performs the same analysis of the basic settings, but it doesn't analyze only the single event but every cycle of compression and extension of your suspension. BYB Telemetry algorithm calculates which adjustment must be made to get the maximum performance on a specific track.  This is just the starting point. We will need your feedback for futures improvements and to add other metrics to our software.       If we reach the 35.000 ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ target we will include the video analysis in our software.With the video analysis you will be able to synchronize the video from your action cam to the data of BYB Telemetry. Such a feature is fundamental when the GPS signal is low and allows the undoubted identification of the obstacles on the track.ÃÂÃÂ   You can see in the video a render of how it will look like. It is a preliminary version that will be improved in terms of graphics when we will include this feature in the software.ÃÂÃÂ          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

We have always wanted to solve one of the biggest problems of the mountain bikers: how to find the best suspension set-up.  From the beginning, the clear idea was to create a premium product, entirely made in Italy, with CNC milled components, top-level motorsport sensor and professional visualization software.  We started collaborating with companies and universities. The first prototype was a proof of principle. From the second one, we reached almost the actual configuration. With the pre-series model, we optimized the layout and tested the final design. During the development process, we were able to reduce the size of the acquisition unit by the half from the initial one.       Designing the mounting brackets for the sensors required different version and prototypes. We tested out different layouts and materials to guarantee the possibility of mounting BYB Telemetry on every MTB.    The algorithms for the automated suspension set-up have been extensively developed and also tested on different bikes, tracks and riders.  BYB Telemetry has been  tested  down the legendary track ""Black Snake""  in  Val di Sole   during the UCI downhill World Cup, where Enrico was a trailblazer.   We had the best return of our efforts when Enrico used the BYB Telemetry pre-series model in the race that proclaimed him national DH champion (overall amateur).             We are first friends than co-founders, and we share the same passions. We know each other from more than ten years, and we shared riding days not only on MTB but also with motorcycle and surf.   The realization of BYB Telemetry is not only the result of our work. We built a network of extremely expert professionals, and incredibly helpful people, from companies which are leaders in their sectors. Without them, the realization of BYB Telemetry would not have been possible.        That's how we want to bring BYB Telemetry to you. In case of a successful campaign, we will deliver you BYB telemetry for the beginning of the next riding season.ÃÂÃÂ                                Risks and challenges  We have been working on BYB Telemetry for more than two years. We have understood the technical, practical and financial challenges. We performed numerous testings in this time frame, and we overcome all the significant technical problems. We have established relationships with local manufacturers and supplier and the final product will be assembled in-house, thereby eliminating the problems that are common with delocalized production. We donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t only have a business-oriented relationship with our suppliers, but also a personal one.  We need to ultimate the final version of the software and developing the app for which we already have contacts and everything just need to be confirmed,in case of succesfull campaign. The algorithms for the automated suspension setting are ready, exaustively tested. Dealing and collaborating with companies which are the leader in their fields has given us much depth of knowledge in the development, production and financial aspects of this campaign.  Considering all of these aspects, we believe then that we can produce the required quantity in accordance with our timeline.   To ensure the delivery of a premium product, we keep a maximum volume of available kits in our Kickstarter campaign. By doing this, we want to have also a close relationship with our backers, providing a one-to-one support in the early stages of use of BYB Telemetry.  Keeping this small amount also guarantees a more straightforward logistic. We will be able to deal with the expeditions individually for every backer.  This journey to create something exceptional wouldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t be possible without all the technical expertise that has been given to us from our collaborators and suppliers. We believe that we can guarantee you a straightforward delivery of a premium product."

All things have started 3 years ago, when together with my wife decided to bring this idea to life, thing that even today is unbeliveble to people without testing a sample. It is a revolutionary product for every person who use the wash masine not just for a simple wash, but for a really luxurious experience. Until now, all the softener and perfume product from the market can make your clothes smell good just for a short time, most of all just few hours...ours instead lasts more than 365 days...It's unbelievable, right? It wasn't easy, two long years full of tests, ups and downs, but we arrived to the final product, and that is the most important thing.        So the things go like that:        Back to our products, we have 4 big strength points, that someone could recognise that our products have a very high quality standard:  1. Time:  Our products last for a very long time, even one year, created and tested in laboratory with chemical engineers, and after tested again with random people, because their feedback is very important to us.  2. Smell:  We start with 6 fragrances, but not a casually one, we recreate the equivalents of the brand famous one. We recreate Giorgio Armani Acqua di Gio, Armani Prive Limited edition, Tom Ford Musk Pure, Bulgari The Vert, Thierry Mugler Crystal Limited edition and Haribo fragrance like.       3. High quality:  All our products were created with naturally essence ingredients, that comes from Germany. Our fragrances are not carcinogenic and corrosive, more than that, are nichel and parabens free, and a long list of toxic and dangerous substance. This is very important because today are a lot of products that can harm us.  4. Price:  This is a very important thing that someone need to understand better. Let me explain why: if we take a famous perfume ""eau de toilette"" of 1.6 oz price of 50 dollars, a 16 oz will cost 500 dollars, but our products compared to an ""eau de toilette"" are 9 times more powerful. Becouse an ""eau de toillet"" has an average percentage 10% of concentration, we are 90%...a really high essence. So if our product is 9 times more concentrated, our price must be 4500 dollars, but the price is just 30 dollars!       ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ 150 times lower! ÃÂÃÂ   Do you imagine that we successfully create a famous brand equivalent fragrances of 16 oz with this price? A very powerful product that didn't exist before, so this is the start of our future Emporio Essenze!  Our fragrances categories are 4: laundry, car, wardrobe and environment.       What can you wish more?  Is not a concept or a prototype, we can enter production very fast, if we reach the budget in 1-2 months we can send all over the world! We give our word that you will be amaised by this perfumes and become a regulary customer.

Thank you all! Together we made history by becoming recipients of first federal research grant in Canada determined by our communities - through crowdfunding. An additional $37,500 will now be released, quadrupling your donations.ÃÂÃÂ   I'm looking forward to continuing the conservation during the next year as we begin our work on the ground.ÃÂÃÂ   If anyone would like to contribute but hasn't yet we have a (kind of) stretch goal: We will use extra cash to pay for additional tests and push our study area further up the Little Campbell River, helping us gain a clearer picture of where land-based sources of pollution are coming from.ÃÂÃÂ   I'm humbled by the incredible community that has come together around this project. Whether you have made a donation or helped spread the word on social media, we couldn't have done it without you. We'll be setting up a project blog, but until then you can stay up-to-date with this project by following us on Facebook @smartshores and Instagram @smartshores.  What we're doing, and why we need your help.  This project is developing a new tool that will reduce the cost of measuring coastal pollution. It will also help the Semiahmoo First Nation with comprehensive pollution testing of their estuary, moving them closer to reopening their shellfish fishery - closed since the 1970s due to pollution.  Your contribution will be used to pay for lab tests, fieldwork expenses and a small salary for PhD students involved in this project.   Each dollar you give will be quadrupled   by a federally-funded research granting agency,  MEOPAR .ÃÂÃÂ The tool that results from this project will support not-for-profits and NGOs working to protect the Salish Sea coast, and can be scaled up to support organizations anywhere in the world.ÃÂÃÂ   We are offering unique aerial images of the Salish Sea coast as rewards for the people helping make this project a reality. These images can be found in a gallery  here.   Our partners include the Semiahmoo First Nation, Ducks Unlimited, Friends of Semiahmoo Bay, the Shared Waters Society, the Semiahmoo Fish and Game Society, the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences and the Michael Smith Labs at the University of British Columbia.ÃÂÃÂ   Detailed information on this project is available below.ÃÂÃÂ      An estuary in the Salish Sea       We were featured on Bloomberg BNN and in the Globe and Mail!    Stand up for a healthy coast!ÃÂÃÂ   A healthy coast means less pollution, sustainable land use practices, healthy animals and healthy people. You can help repair and protect our common environment by putting the right tools in the hands of the people working hard to clean up and protect our shores. This is a pilot project in crowdfunded science and   every dollar you give will be quadrupled by a federally-funded research granting agency   (MEOPAR) to support the development of tools that will reduce the cost of pollution testing and mapping - but this project doesn't happen unless we hit our fundraising goal.ÃÂÃÂ If our campaign is successful we will produce a video giving you a look behind-the-scenes of this project and showcasing the stories of the people protecting our coast. We will also make our results public for all to see.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ      Estuaries are big, pollution tests are expensive. Connecting tests with maps can save costs by interpolating the concentration of pollutants.    You can help make the coast healthier  This project will develop a low-cost test for fertilizers (organophosphates) and hydrocarbons stored in soil and clay. This tool will empower organizations with restricted budgets, like not-for-profits, to identify common pollutants in the areas they are working to protect and restore.  We will also develop an algorithm for predicting detailed pollution concentrations throughout a site that combines low-cost maps built by drones and soil/substrate test results. This will produce a detailed map of pollution hot spots, helping to identify where pollution is coming from and how it is flowing through a site.  Our goal is for these tools to be used anywhere, but before people use them they need to know they can trust the results. That's why we're also conducting a rigorous case study in Surrey, BC in collaboration with world-class research institutes and testing our approach in a real-world setting with great NGOs.ÃÂÃÂ   We are working with the  Michal Smith Labs at the University of British Columbia , the  Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences  and  pollutiontracker.org  to produce world-class research that we submit for publication in peer-reviewed journals. We will work with the Semiahmoo First Nation,  Ducks Unlimited ,  A Rocha , the  Semiahmoo Fish and Game Club  and  Friends of Semiahmoo Bay  to ensure that the tools we develop are useful, user-friendly, and focused on providing actionable environmental management insights.     Drone-derived maps show elevations, sediments, vegetation, and soon - pollution     Real-World Impact   This project will have a direct impact on the health of the Little Campbell Estuary by providing needed pollution data to support environmental planning in this urban river and coastline that will support healthy salmon, cleaner shellfish, and safer food for Killer Whales and people.ÃÂÃÂ   It will also support the Semiahmoo First Nation in working toward re-opening their shellfish fishery. Shellfish are a source of traditional, local food for the Semiahmoo people and shellfish harvesting is an important way of teaching youth about their culture. The shellfish fishery in Semiahmoo territory has been closed due to pollution since the 1970s. Pollution levels in shellfish may be low enough today for the fishery to be reopened but this has not been tested due to costs. It remains illegal to harvest shellfish due to the potential risk to human health. If pollution levels in shellfish are found to be within acceptable limits the Semiahmoo Nation will have data to support the re-opening of their fishery. If not, they will know how polluted the shellfish are, where the pollution is coming from, and can plan for remediation with the aim of eventually re-opening the fishery.     Many pollutants are invisible, and hiding in the soil    Thank you!ÃÂÃÂ   Thank you for reading this far. Please read our FAQ and get in touch if you have any questions about this project, share this page with friends, and if you are able, make a donation for a healthy coast today.ÃÂÃÂ   More detailed information on the technical aspects of this project is available below. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ      A channel flows through an estuary at low tide. At high tide, this sand is 4m under water.     What's happening on-site and in the lab  We will map the lower Little Campbell and estuary using drones, collect soil samples and take tissue samples from shellfish. The location of each soil and shellfish sample will be tagged with an ultra-high precision GPS unit. We'll then send these samples to a lab for comprehensive testing for over one-hundred contaminants (we will follow the sampling protocol used by Ocean Wise here: www.pollutiontracker.org).ÃÂÃÂ   Once we have lab results showing the type and concentration of pollutants at each sample location we will combine these data with our drone-derived map showing elevations, vegetation and substrate types. This will allow us to understand the slope and porosity of the terrain so that we can model how pollution transported in water (either directly or trapped in particles) flows through and accumulates within a site. We will then build a mathematical model that uses a subset of these pollution samples to interpolate the concentration of pollutants throughout the site. By using a selection of GPS tagged lab results we can use this model to predict how much pollution is where. This helps identify pollution hot-spots while reducing the number of tests needed per site to do so and the first step in reducing the cost of pollution testing.ÃÂÃÂ   The second step in reducing the cost of pollution testing is to develop a low-cost test for identifying the presence and amount of key pollutants, like pesticides and hydrocarbons. We will do this by testing and refining a prototype biosensor. A biosensor is an organism (in this case a bacteria) that is modified to fluoresce (glow) when it comes into contact with a certain substance (more on this below, in the last section called  For science nerds like us ). We will field-test prototype tools that are similar to a litmus paper but instead of measuring acidity they will measure pesticides and hydrocarbons. This cheap tool can be brought into the field and used to detect the presence and concentration of pollutants within minutes of sampling. In some cases, this will be enough information to support environmental management planning. In cases where this is not enough it will help practitioners identify where, and how many, samples are needed to be collected and sent to the lab. This will reduce the number of samples taken in the field and reduce testing costs.ÃÂÃÂ    For science nerds like us...   In case you were wondering what's under the hood of a biosensor, we're building what's called a Whole Cell Bioindicator (WCB). A WCB is made from a  Escherichia coli  BL21(DE3) protein expression host strain that is transformed with a plasmid pIDR containing:  - A pollutant-sensitive transcriptional regulator gene ( pstr ) encoded on the coding strand under the control of a constitutive promoter (pC). This gene encodes the PSTR protein, which can bind the pollutant of interest. Upon binding, a conformational change in the PSTR-pollutant complex allows binding to the pPSTR promoter-operator region of the fluorescent reporter gene eliciting the concentration-dependent response (as fluorescence).  - A green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) reporter gene, encoded on the template strand, under the control of the PSTR-regulator promoter operator region (pPSTR). This gene encodes the sfGFP fluorescent protein with excitation and emission maxima of 488nm and 530nm, respectively.  - An antibiotic (ampicillin) resistance marker gene  ApR   - A pMB1 origin of replication  This vector was previously designed and synthesized to respond to certain members of the organophosphate family of pesticides chlorpyrifos, ethyl/methyl paraoxon, ethyl/methyl parathion and diazinon, using the  pstr  gene  ChpR 1. We will be testing a field-kit version of this and synthesizing a new WCB to respond to a key pollutant to be determined following our analysis of lab results during this project.ÃÂÃÂ   For more info on this process, and on the mathematical modelling of pollution throughout a site based on drone maps please donate and follow our progress! :DÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  This project involves the production of a video, scientific research that will identify and map pollutants, and the development of a new technique to make this process more efficient. While we hope to produce final products that can be commercially available, this project budget does not cover industrial design. As a result, the final tools we produce may provide value-added support to people working in the field rather than being stand-alone commercial products."

'The Cleg' stood out as a high end brake ahead of its time. The companies hydraulic gyro the 'Trixer' was famous amongst dirt jumpers around the world and Trickstuff brakepads are known to improve any brake ever since. In 2009 an engineer and cyclist from Freiburg - Klaus Liedler -joined the company and paved the path for new products and ideas. The success of the Direttissima is a turning point in the companies history. As a bunch of bike lovers who just want to make great parts and ride our bikes we suddenly felt like the center of bike enthusiasts attention around the globe. It took some time to adjust but we do love it and want to keep earning this.,1.0,2018-07-12 12:20:53 -0400,Backed 1 project,KO,7,"The company Trickstuff has been making brakes for 17 years now. During all this time Trickstuff has not only built brakes in Germany but has always produced extraordinary and test winning brake pads and other bike parts. 10 years ago, Klaus Liedler joined the company and has pushed the development and evolution of all our products. 3 years ago the Direttissima brake marked the start of a new chapter in the company's history.ÃÂÃÂ    Fromit's introduction, the Direttissima's value has been proven on many occasions. World cup riders are putting it to the test on the highest levels of the sport. Amateurs abuse it on a daily basis. The international bike media praises it as the best brake you can buy for money. Its reputation is growing constantly, and the demand rises just as fast.ÃÂÃÂ   You can read about the Direttissima if you click on the links below:            ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ              The Direttissima -  strong, prooven and beautiful     It has bothered us that the Direttissima is not undisputed when it comes to the title of ""Highest Braking Power"" even though it is considered the brake that needs the least arm strength. The Sram Code, Magura MT7, and especially Formula Cura4 are strong contenders depending on the measuring method.ÃÂÃÂ   We wanted to push the boundaries and see if we could not only make a brake that is undoubtedly stronger than anything we've known so far but is still reasonably light and does not stop you like a stick between your spokes. Reliable, intuitive modulation is a Must-Have for any brake. This is why we set out to create the MAXIMA.     The MAXIMA!     The MAXIMA - stronger for better riding.ÃÂÃÂ    We've often been asked if stronger brakes are necessary. In the end all real Mountainbike brakes are strong enough to lock your wheels and allow you to skid around. More force will not help with that. That is correct but that is not what this is about.ÃÂÃÂ   We all know how forearms and fingers feel after a great day in the bike park. The arms hurt, you can't stretch your fingers, every bump on the trail tests your strength and your front suspension doesn't feel as sensitiveÃÂÃÂ  as it did at the start of the day.ÃÂÃÂ   The Maxima can help with that.ÃÂÃÂ   The diagram below shows the result of a comparison of the Maxima and other brakes on the market. The Maxima doesn't help you by being able to lock up a wheel even stronger. It helps you by needing way less finger power to get there. The dotted line represents an assumed braking power at which your wheel would lock up under certain conditions. As you can see, you will need different amounts of finger strength with different brakes. Below this dotted line is your ""working range"" of applied finger strength or used braking power in real life situations. The Maxima allows you to work with a lot less of your own strength.     Dyno test results of the MAXIMA compared to other brakes. These tests were done in our own facility on our own dyno.    This will spare your forearms and fingers. You will have more strength to hold on to your bars and take the hits that your suspension passes on to you. You will be able to ride longer and/or harder. It will be easier to modulate the braking power, and your suspension fork will feel even better.

From an economic point of view, we do not have to make the MAXIMA, we might even be creating competition within our own product range. Is there a demand for a brake like the MAXIMA? It is super strong, exquisite, beautiful and comes with a price tag. Made in Germany, built in small quantities...ÃÂÃÂ   But we really want to realise the MAXIMA. After all, we are just bike lovers who want to create the most fantastic bike parts. This is why we have decided to involve you into our decision-making process and started this Kickstarter campaign. You can be part of it and make it come true.  We do already have working prototypes, that ran through all stages of production as they will be in the future. The brakes have been ridden by  Mick Hannah  and  Nina Hoffmann  in the Downhill World cup and the Downhill World Championships. Our Trail &amp; Trial Rider  Jakob Breitwieser  is proving the incredible modulation of the MAXIMA on a daily basis.ÃÂÃÂ   Nina received her Prototype three day before the world championships finals in Lenzerheide 2018. She had two days of practice with the new brake when we surprised her with this little interview.         You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

If we reach the goal, we will build a batch of brakes for supporters of this project. They will be built in the beginning of 2019. The exact time frame will be communicated once it is known how many brakes will have to be build. The first batch of MAXIMA is limited only to our professional team riders and the supporters of this campaign. It will only be available to others months after our supporters have received their brakes.        Risks and challenges  There are two challenges during this project:  Our growing company has run into problems regarding workflow when the demand for Direttissima and Piccola skyrocketed. This resulted in long waiting periods for our customers. The limitation of the first batch to this campaign will minimize this problem and allow a smooth integration of the MAXIMA into our product range.  The second problem is the demand for the MAXIMA. High end products with unequalled performance always get a lot of attention. We have had more media requests and more social media interactions regarding the MAXIMA than we have had for any other product ever before. But how many people will buy it? We thought about producing a limited amount, but we would rather have you decide and provide everyone with a MAXIMA who wants to buy one."

We have a confession: We hate washing dishes. Actually, 99% of people hate washing dishes. And that got us thinking: What can we do to improve the dishwashing experience? All along, the answer was right there in front of us, soaking up germs...like a sponge.ÃÂÃÂ   ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s taken years. Many noble sponges were sacrificed, but we kept at it and have now forged a weapon that scrubs the way to victory. This is the Ares Kit.

If you are familiar with these growing techniques, you know the benefits, but also quite familiar with the weakness of these gardening techniques.ÃÂÃÂ   These delicately balanced eco-systems are easy to fail, so you have to check all the key-parameters and specifics on a daily basis to keep everything under control.   AquaShield  changes this and  launch your hydroponics or aquaponics garden to the 21st century .ÃÂÃÂ We believe, that  AquaShield is the world's most advanced monitoring and controlling device for hydroponics and aquaponics .            AquaShield  includes various sensors  to keep track vital factors in your garden's environment, such as  temperature ,  pH  or  conductivity . The system also measures  water levels, activates pumps  to circulate the water and controls light intensity to boost Your gardenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s vitality.ÃÂÃÂ        AquaShield can  host up to 15 sensors to monitor  your mini environment:ÃÂÃÂ             For  getting total control  of Your mini environment, AquaShiled is also able to control  8 high voltage relays . Redundant water pumps, controlled grow lights, additional heating are not challenges for AquaShield.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        AquaShield could be  connected to the internet  through LAN or WIFI. Thanks to this feaure, you could get  real time data  about your hydroponic or aquaponic system, no matter where you are. If you don't want to connect your device to the net, you could run AquaShield on it's own.ÃÂÃÂ        But there's much more that AquaShield is capable of: through the  web app , you could  control the 8 relays or create rules ,  according to which your garden is functioning by. ÃÂÃÂ        Since there is a ton of information about your system's health it is easy to get lost in data or even miss an important event just because of the massive data flow.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Therefore we  created alerts  and  notifications . In AquaShield's web app you can set up alerts and create workflows in case such events happen, like your PH spikes. In a traditional hydroponic or aquaponic setup it will take at least a day to recognize this (also it is possible that you only take PH sample in every 2 days).ÃÂÃÂ   With AquaShield you could  get an email  and / or a  notification  to your phone immediately so you will have more time to act.       This function will give you free hand to  create your own cycle setups . Eg. turn on the #1 cycle pump for 15 minutes at every hour, than wait 30 minutes and turn on #2 cycle pump for 15 minutes.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Or turn on the grow lights for 18 hours at every morning but after 4 week (when germination stage is over) drop it to 12 hours per day.ÃÂÃÂ   With  AquaShield  you can  create complex jobs  for your garden in seconds.       AquaShield is the  4th iteration of our original idea , and through the prototypes we realized that different applications would need different setups: Eg. for aquaponics it is necessary to measure PH or dissolved oxygen in the fish tank or check the moisture of the growing media, but for hydroponics your essential data for maintaining a high performance is measure electrical conductivity (EC) and temperature of the circulated liquid.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   For these reasons we decided to  build AquaShield as a modular project . With this concept in mind we divided the whole system to  3 submodules :ÃÂÃÂ        All modules are connected through  CAN BUS communication , and you could  add several same type modules  for your setup if needed (eg. a ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Sensor module #1ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ could gather data from max. 4 sensors, so if you would like to have 6 PH sensor you can add another ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Sensor module #1ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ and connect the 2 remaining sensors there).ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   For keeping the costs at the minimum, we decided to use DIN RAIL for mounting and connecting the modules. Also you would be able to add cheap power supplies, industrial relays or high voltage sockets. You  won't need any fancy parts  to start up your project.ÃÂÃÂ        This is the brain of the project. Actually itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a container for the  BRAIN . This module  holds a Raspberry Pi  that runs the software for the AquaShield ControlÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s operation (we call this package  AquaShield Connect  because you will be able to reach your device ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> through internet ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> with this).ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Also the MAIN CONTROL MODULE holds all the  controllable relays (8)  for pumps, grow lights, air pumps, heaters, feeders or any type of device you would like to control via your AquaShield.ÃÂÃÂ        In addition, this module would hold connectors to  detect water level switch states ÃÂÃÂ (so if your water level drops below minimum, you could receive a warning to your phone or create a workflow based on this warning).ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        This module is in charge for  checking all the vital parameters  of the water you cycle in your system. The module could hold 4 sensors that could be:ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ     PH  sensorÃÂÃÂ    EC  sensor (electrical conductivity)ÃÂÃÂ    DO  sensor (dissolved oxygen)ÃÂÃÂ    ORP  sensor (oxidation reduction potential)   This module is  highly variable . ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s possible to set up the module with 4 different sensors, but you can choose to have only one sensor or even 4 sensor from the same type. It is possible, because the sensor controlling circuits are removable and changeable.ÃÂÃÂ        This module has regular  BNC connectors , so you would easily connect your available  PH ,  EC  (electrical conductivity),  ORP  (oxidation reduction potential) or  DO  (dissolved oxygen) probes. Since these probes work at the same principle you should get the same results but if you ask us, we recommend  Atlas Scientific devices !ÃÂÃÂ   Since we started the AquaShield project, we always used  Atlas Scientific's  products as benchmarks and we could only say the best about them.       We do not have an official reward for this, but please let us know, if you would  need probes (PH, EC, ORP  or  DO) for your setup , so we could work out a partnership with Atlas Scientific (and you could get a discount).ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        This module is responsible to check all other  environmental factors . It is able to  receive data from 4 temperature , a  light - and a  humidity  sensor.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        It connects to the other units through CAN BUS and you could also jumper the module (so you can link together even 16 Sensor module #2 ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> if you want to).ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        The SENSOR MODULE #2 comes with it's own  extension , which is a  light intensity  and  humidity sensor . Light measuring could be tricky, so we wanted be sure, that you could place the light/humidity sensor, where ever you like.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Also you could chain up multiple sensors, so you could  map your garden  and optimize your planting.       We  wanted to create a product  for both  hobbyist  and  professional users . For this, the AquaShield has to be a hightech, yet affordable system with outstanding monitoring and controlling features.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   To satisfy every need, we created four different packages:   AQUASHIELD FULL CONTROL   We created this package for hobbyist who struggle controlling their hydroponics or aquaponics setup.ÃÂÃÂ        This package contains:ÃÂÃÂ     AQUASHIELD MAIN CONTROL MODULE    2 X WATER LEVEL SWITCH    With this module's  8 controllable relays  it will be easy to set up the  perfect cycling routine  or program your grow lights, vents etc. Also you will be able to set up 6 water level switches, so you could monitor all your fish and sump tanks easily.

THE AQUASHIELD BRAIN  AquaShield is a complex project for sure! It's a  controlling  and  monitoring  device with  real time data  and ÃÂÃÂ sophisticated alerting features.ÃÂÃÂ    To keep the costs at the minimum but also be able to handle all these complex tasks, we turned to an old friend: theÃÂÃÂ  Rasperry Pi !ÃÂÃÂ    Raspberry Pi  is a  powerful microcomputer , that provides a wide variety of accesible functions, such as running a local server, video streaming etc. and it comes with a reasonable price!  Our  Raspberry Pi  is located in the  MAIN CONTROL MODULE:        The Raspberry Pi runs our own software, the  AquaShield Connect , thatÃÂÃÂ will be available as a  free download , so if you already have a Raspberry Pi at home, you could just use that device.ÃÂÃÂ   If you don't have a spare Raspberry at home, you can have aÃÂÃÂ  Raspberry Pi  with a  class 10 SD card  (pre-installed  AquaShield Connect ):       You only have to  add 65 $  whichever rewards you choose.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        We believe in  transparency  and  open communicatio n so we created a bunch of  demonstration videos  for showing that AquaShield is really working and not just a concept or a prototype. We hope that these videos will dispel all your doubts (if you have any) and  give you the confidence to back our project !  TESTING THE RELAYSÃÂÃÂ   In this video we wanted to  demonstrate how you could control the 8 relays  on the AquaShield main control module. In this test, we use the 1st and the 2nd relay output, which are connected to high voltage relays (you can use all kind of commercial or industrial relays as well) and electrical sockets. We connected a  600 W grow light  and an  air pump  to the system as well.ÃÂÃÂ   We control the AquaShield through the  AquaShield Connect webapp . At the app we switch to the Controllers tab to operate the relays. In default, all relays are set to  AUTO  status, so you could create programs for operating these (based on a sensorÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s parameter or on a time schedule). For testing or manually operating a relay you can always use the  MANUAL  status.ÃÂÃÂ       For controlling the grow light and the air pump, first we switch the relays to MANUAL status, than switch on and later off the 2 relays. Check out how these cool relays work!  TESTING THE SENSOR PROBES AND THE WATER LEVEL SWITCH   In this video we wanted to  demonstrate how you can receive data from your sensors . In default all the sensors are displayed at the main  Dashboard  tab in the  AquaShield Connect webapp . You can check the following sensorÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s values:  PH ,  EC  (electrical conductivity),  ORP  (oxidation reduction potential),  DO  (dissolved oxygen),  temperature ,  humidity ,  light intensity  and the status of the  water level switches .      All the  values are created as averages , so you will get more  accurate results . The AquaShield Connect app is refreshed every 10 sec, but you can trigger the refresh manually as well (as you can see at the beginning of the video). ÃÂÃÂ   Also you can see,  how the status of the water level switch changes , as we close and than reopen the level switch. By monitoring the status of the level switches you  can easily create alerts , so you will be the first to know if there is not enough water in the tank, or  overflow is going to happen. You can also create a workflow to start or stop a pump if such event happens. Smart, smart AquaShield.  CHECKING HISTORICAL DATA   Besides the real time sensor parameters, the AquaShield is  capable of storing all the historical data gathered  from the probes.  All  historical data is accessible  from the AquaShield Connect web app. At the appÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s  Dashboard  you can check all the connected sensorsÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> real time values and also you can display the sensorÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s  stored data for the past 48 hours . With this feature you can easily detect PH or temperature swings or other suboptimal events.      In the video you can see how the  EC and the temperature probeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s historical data  is displayed in the app. Also you are able to display and analyze all stored data and even download it in XLS or CSV format. We are planning to create a public space where  AquaShield users can share their historical data  and other details about their hydroponic or aquaponic setup. Sharing is caring :)  ALERTS AND NOTIFICATIONS   We created  alerts and notifications for AquaShield  that you can receive to your phone or via email. Thanks to this you  wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t miss any important event  and you will have more time to act. You can create alerts and notifications at the  Triggers  tab in the AquaShield web app.  In these demonstration videos you will see how you can  set up a PH and a temperature alert .   For the  PH sensor  we set up the AquaShield to send an alert and a notification if the PH drops below 5,3 or exceeds 8,3.ÃÂÃÂ       For the  temperature probe  we set the alert if the temperature drops below 16C. All set and good to go!           AquaShield is  commercial ready ! We already did all the preparation, needed for production of larger quantities. We have all the stencils for  manufacturing the PCB boards  and the  machine routines  for implanting the parts for creating the AquaShield modules.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        Also we did a  number of test runs in the factory , so we are sure, there will be  no trouble ramping up the production .ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   The housing parts of the PCB-s are largely commercially available - and the other parts will be produced at small quantities with a reasonable price at a local injection molding shop.  We contracted all partners involved in manufacturing the AquaShield so  there are no blind spots  or unknown factors in the process.ÃÂÃÂ   We think that this Kickstarter campaign is the first step on a long road for AquaShield.  We plan long-term , so our main goal is to deliver the best product for You!       We wanted to  create the best monitoring and controlling device  to secure your fragile ecosystem and we also wanted to  give it such style , you could present proudly next to your magnificent plants and fish.We have a long-standing attraction about the Voronoi diagrams so we decided to incorporate it to our design.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        And it turned out better than we've expected :) The  Voronoi pattern will only be presented  on the top cover, all other parts of the moduleÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s case is an industrial grade boxing specially designed for circuits and other electrical devices (although all the modules will operate at low voltage).To have a precise fit we printed several models and we tested all of them.ÃÂÃÂ        We think, this will be far the  best monitoring and controlling device  for your hydroponics or aquaponics setup. You will be able to check all the  vital parameters  of your fragile ecosystem in real time and  control it through the internet  from anywhere.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   You will also be able to create your own workflows and set up alerts for the most diverse emergency.  Sounds like sci-fi? It isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t.  Here is the chance to get your hand on one of the first AquaShield's.  What are you waiting for? Back us now and let's get growing!             ABOUT USÃÂÃÂ   The  AquaShield team  includes electronics professionals, engineers, designers, developers, hydroponics and aquaponics enthusiasts collectively having over  100 years experience bringing complex products to market .  AquaShieldÃÂÃÂ  founder GÃÂÃÂ¡bor Sulcz  is an engineer with an urge  to improve and optimize all things around , in particular to projects that could really improve people's quality of life.  But  there is no great goal, that could be reached alone . So here's the whole crew:           Risks and challenges  AquaShield is ready to start production as soon as we reach the funding goal. We already have a manufacturer in place and have finished all preparations and tests.   As you can see from the video and product demos, AquaShield is pretty much working and completed. Our engineers and developers are very confident in delivering the product on time.  All our products are engineered and manufactured in Europe. We've spent over a 3 years working on the AquaShield. We've had three major versions and with each version we've learned and improved our product.  Prior to AquaShield, our team spent over 15 years developing and engineering close to a hundred new and innovative products such as weather stations, battery managements systems, bluetooth communication based logger, electric bike and electric car controlling boards etc.   Many of these products are significantly more complex (but not as cool) as AquaShield, but thankfully it has put us in to a position to be able to deliver our project on time.  Unfortunately with all projects, unforeseen manufacturing or shipping problems are a possibility. We believe we have taken all reasonable steps to prevent such issues, and believe that we will be able to deliver a high quality, fast charging, and reliable product.  This is not our first project, so we know that no development project is straightforward and should the project experience any delays then we will communicate to our customers to keep them updated and in the loop."

Keep in mind that this product is much more complex than others on Kickstarter - there have been few A/C outlet powerbanks before ours, and none that are IP67 waterproof. Thus, we had many firsts to accomplish. As we transition to full scale production, if order quantities are very large, we will produce in smaller phases, so as to never overproduce an underperforming product. We have 20 quality control steps with each PWR 27 we produce, and we tolerate zero flaws."

High Efficiency       Legion Solar micro-inverters are designed to achieve ideal system match for high efficiency DC to AC conversion. Up to 32 micro-inverters can be connected in a daisy-chain. Our micro-inverters employ maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technology to achieve maximum power output in full sun and partial shade conditions. LegionConnexÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ wiring simplifies connectivity ideally suited for the do-it-yourself installer.  Micro-inverters outperform that of traditional central inverters due to no single point of failure. Each inverter cell works independently of each other to maximize energy production in partial cloud or shady conditions.  Safety features are also included called anti-islanding. A feature to immediately shut down solar power production from back feeding to the grid to protect line workers.  Intelligent Control and Monitoring       Solar Regulator enables you to contain the solar energy that you produce behind your utility meter by regulating energy production of each Micro-Inverter so that energy production is less than or equal to energy consumption. If you turn on an appliance such as a dryer, Solar Regulator detects your increased consumption and automatically signals the Micro-Inverters to produce more energy. When excess production is available Solar Regulator signals to BatteryCommander to charge the batteries. This active learning computer works 24/7 to monitor and regulate your energy production. Since you are containing the energy behind your utility meter  where the utility company does not own  and you are not selling excess energy back, interconnection  permission is not necessary .  SolarRegulatorÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s bluetooth interface allows you to monitor your energy production and consumption, check system health, and more via the LegionSolar App for Apple/Android.  BatteryCommanderÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ (New)       BatteryCommander connects in between the micro inverter and the solar panel. During daylight solar energy is used to supplement usage from your utility company and charge the batteries. At night, batteries supplement your usage enabling Legion Solar to completely offset all of your daytime and nighttime consumption.  Compatible with standard Sealed Lead Acid Batteries (widely available and safer than Lithium), two deep cycle 12V batteries connected in series with capacity range 40-60Ah is recommended for each BatteryCommander branch.  OffGridControllerÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ (New)       OffGrid Controller is a combiner hub for your batteries to multiply usable capacity. It detects when grid power goes down and automatically turns on power to the backup inverter to supply power to an off grid branch circuit where you can power all of your basic necessities in any emergency.ÃÂÃÂ When power goes out, lights and appliances connected to this branch automatically turn on. When power comes back, the emergency branch circuit automatically turns off.  Legion Solar 3 Improvements   Micro-Inverter optimal output power increased from 200W (Gen2) to 250W (Gen3)    Micro-Inverter efficiency improved by up to 1.7%    Micro-Inverter communication changed from PLC to Wireless 2.4GHz    Solar Regulator communication changed from PLC (Gen2) to Wireless 2.4GHz (Gen3)    Solar Regulator firmware improvements with compatibility with BatteryCommander UnitsÃÂÃÂ     Starter Set Solar Panel wattage increased from 200W (Gen2) to 300W (Gen3)    Maximum Legion Solar total System size increased from 6.4kW to 9.6kW    Legion Solar app to add support for BatteryCommander   Tax Incentives      IRS Form 3468     2018-2019 tax credit is 30%, 2020 tax credit is 26%, 2021 tax credit is 22%, 2022 and onward tax credit is 10% for commercial installations only.

ÃÂÃÂ Its smooth operation will help you spin gorgeous yarn.ÃÂÃÂ   Where can you spin?   In your comfy chair at home    At work during your lunch break    While binge watching your favorite show    With your knitting group    At a fiber retreat    In the park        Stretch Goals   (INCLUDED) $150K - Add a spin card    (INCLUDED) $200K - Add second color option for the Electric Eel Wheel Mini 2    (INCLUDED) $250K - Add a spare drive belt and tension band    (INCLUDED) $400K - Add a third color option for just the bobbin   Good for New and Experienced Spinners  This design is great for people learning to spin because it is easy to use and is the least expensive spinning wheel available these days. ÃÂÃÂ This means you can learn to spin quickly without spending a fortune. ÃÂÃÂ Many people find the Mini has everything they need in a spinning wheel.  Mini users have found that it is exceptionally well suited to use during travel or for teaching children to spin. ÃÂÃÂ Many experienced spinners report using the Mini for spinning in places they never could before, and some have completely switched over to the Mini for all their spinning.  Name Change  This project was originally called the ""Electric Eel Wheel Mini 2"" and towards the end of this Kickstarter the name changed to the ""Electric Eel Wheel Nano"". ÃÂÃÂ Both of those names refer to this project.  Open DesignÃÂÃÂ        One of the first things you might notice about the Mini 2 is its beautiful and stunning open design which serves an important purpose during spinning. ÃÂÃÂ It allows the spinner to see the yarn being wound onto the bobbin from all angles. This was one of the features the beta testers really loved about the new Mini.  I'd like to give a special thanks Caitlin Youngquist, an industrial designer, who volunteered her time and efforts to make this design possible.  Quieter Design  This new design is much quieter, thanks in large part to the addition of ball bearings which reduce friction and vibration on each end of the flyer. ÃÂÃÂ The much lower sound level of the Mini 2 makes it a joy to use when you're out with friends or spinning in public places.ÃÂÃÂ   Thoughtful Design  ÃÂÃÂ Many useful features have been added to the new design:ÃÂÃÂ    A switch to change the direction of the flyer. There are three positions: clockwise, off, and counterclockwise.    Slotted holes in the flat bottom allow screw or clamp mounting options.    Roving slots hold your roving so your singles don't untwist between spinning sessions.    Magnetic orifice hook holder to help prevent lost orifice hooks.        Included Items   Electric Eel Wheel Mini 2  is the base unit. ÃÂÃÂ This lets you spin the fiber into yarn. ÃÂÃÂ A standard power supply and orifice hook is included with the base unit.   Bobbins  store the yarn you spin. ÃÂÃÂ Each bobbin holds over one ounce (30 grams) of yarn. ÃÂÃÂ The beta testers are fitting 1.4 to 2 ounces on a bobbin, but it could be less if you're spinning bulky yarn.  Optional Items   USB Power Cord  lets you spin from a USB battery pack. ÃÂÃÂ There is a section below that explains this in more detail.ÃÂÃÂ    Orifice Reducer  is plug that goes into the front of the flyer, which helps reduce the wobble when spinning thin singles. ÃÂÃÂ Some spinners really like feature. ÃÂÃÂ However, others don't care to use it, so it's a personal preference as to whether you want to use it or not.       Color Options    This section has been updated.    Initially I was planning to only have a single color. ÃÂÃÂ However, I got a lot of requests from backers for another color option. ÃÂÃÂ Thanks to the overwhelming support for this project I was able to negotiate a fair deal with my manufacturer and now there will be two color options for the base and three color options for bobbins.  The base colors are purple and charcoal.ÃÂÃÂ      Charcoal base with an ivory bobbin    The bobbin colors are purple, ivory, and teal.     Teal bobbin    You will select your color choice when I collect shipping address information from all the backers next year.  Power Options  ÃÂÃÂ The power supply that comes with the standard package plugs into the wall. ÃÂÃÂ It works with voltages around the world, and it has a  Type A plug .ÃÂÃÂ  If you don't have Type A plugs in your country, you would need to provide a physical adapter to convert from Type A to the plug type you have, or you use the USB power cord.ÃÂÃÂ   To make this spinning wheel ultra-portable get the Plus option, which includes a USB power cord. ÃÂÃÂ With this cord you can use a USB battery pack and be independent from your wall outlet. ÃÂÃÂ It is easy to buy USB battery packs  online  or at your local big-box store. ÃÂÃÂ Even the small and inexpensive 10000 mAh USB battery packs will provide well over 20 hours of spinning on the Mini.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        If you are a techie and are interested in making your own power cord or using some other power sources, the Electric Eel Wheel Mini 2 has a 5.5 x 2.1 mm barrel jack and expects 9V at 1A.  Plying  Plying yarn is when you take two or more separate singles you have already spun and twist them together.ÃÂÃÂ  To do this you must twist the singles together in the opposite direction than you have spun them.ÃÂÃÂ  The Mini has a switch on its side that lets you reverse the direction of the flyer, which makes plying on this wheel very easy.  Here is a quote from Tanya one of the beta testers: ""  I was very pleased with just how well the Mini 2 handled chain plying. Plenty of take up, even at slow speed, made this task quick and easy.  ""       Ease of Use  This spinning wheel is easy to use. ÃÂÃÂ With drop spindles or treadle spinning wheels you can be distracted by the extra movements of your hands and feet. ÃÂÃÂ With the Electric Eel Wheel Mini 2, you can put your focus on drafting and feeding the fiber onto the bobbin. ÃÂÃÂ With the Mini, you can focus on the fun!  Getting it setup to spin is also very easy. ÃÂÃÂ The speed control is a dial, and tension is controlled with an elastic band. ÃÂÃÂ The metal sliding yarn guides are a breeze to use. ÃÂÃÂ Overall the design is simple and intuitive.  Learning to Spin  The best way to learn to spin is to either find someone, perhaps at your local knitting group, or watch some online videos. ÃÂÃÂ Finding someone with spinning experience is great is because you can more quickly learn from their first-hand knowledge. ÃÂÃÂ On the other hand learning from videos is convenient and works for many people. ÃÂÃÂ There are  many free online videos  about this. ÃÂÃÂ I have even made a  spinning tutorial using a previous version of the Electric Eel Wheel , and I hope to make updates in the near future.  Overview of the Controls  The switch on the Mini turns it on and controls direction. ÃÂÃÂ When the switch is forward it spins clockwise. ÃÂÃÂ When the switch is backwards it spins counterclockwise. ÃÂÃÂ When the switch is in the middle the wheel is off.  The speed control dial (Figure 1) controls the speed of the motor from completely stopped to full speed. ÃÂÃÂ The max speed of this spinning wheel is about 600-800 RPMs. ÃÂÃÂ This is similar to a medium speed standard foot driven spinning wheel. ÃÂÃÂ Many experienced spinners will spin near the max speed and new spinners can select a slow speed with the dial until they get more experience.     Figure 1    The tension band fits in a groove on the bobbin. ÃÂÃÂ In general, it is best to spin with a light tension on the Mini. ÃÂÃÂ To increase the tension pull the tension band (Figure 2) down through the groove. ÃÂÃÂ Increased tension will increase ÃÂÃÂ how firmly the wheel pulls the yarn onto the bobbin. ÃÂÃÂ If you let the fiber out of your hand more quickly it will give the yarn less twist. ÃÂÃÂ If you let the fiber out of your hand more slowly it will give you more twist.  The orifice hook is used to help thread the fiber on the flyer. ÃÂÃÂ There are magnets on the base of the Mini that hold the orifice hook securely.ÃÂÃÂ      Figure 2    When there is a buildup of yarn on your bobbin stop the flyer, and slide the yarn guide over (Figure 3). ÃÂÃÂ Then start spinning again. ÃÂÃÂ This is how you can evenly fill the bobbin. ÃÂÃÂ The slide arms on the Mini's flyer have a triangular shape to prevent the yarn guides from rotating.     Figure 3    Changing the bobbin on the Mini is easy (Figure 4.) ÃÂÃÂ Take the drive belt off the front of the flyer and the tension band off the back part of the bobbin. ÃÂÃÂ Then slide the flyer out of the braces and remove the back bearing and the bobbin. ÃÂÃÂ Put the new bobbin back on the flyer,ÃÂÃÂ and then replace the drive belt and tension band.     Figure 4    There are grooves in the case near the front. ÃÂÃÂ This is where you place your fiber there when you're done spinning so it doesn't untwist between spinning sessions.  Compared to Other Spinning Wheels  It is important to realize the Mini is a new category of spinning wheel.ÃÂÃÂ  It is faster and easier to use than a drop spindle, and it is available at an amazing price that no other spinning wheel on the market approaches. Its design makes it great for new spinners and more experienced spinners who want an affordable travel-friendly wheel.ÃÂÃÂ  However, the Mini is not meant to work as a production spinning wheel.ÃÂÃÂ  If you are an experienced spinner who wants a lot of speed and big bobbins don't expect this to replace your primary spinning wheel.  Electric Eel Wheel Community  One of the aspects that makes this a great spinning wheel is the online social community. ÃÂÃÂ Spinners frequently share their latest yarn projects and there are always some helpful and positive reviews. ÃÂÃÂ This community is also the place where people discuss new ideas for spinning wheels and other fiber related tools. ÃÂÃÂ I frequently post ideas long before they go public. ÃÂÃÂ For example, I've been posting information about the Electric Eel Wheel Mini 2 for over 6 months to this community and received valuable feedback that has helped me make it much better than I could have by myself.  If you want to join there are two places people have gathered so feel free to join either one (or both.)    Electric Eel Wheel Group on Facebook      Electric Eel Wheel Group on Ravelry    Quotes and Pictures from Beta Users  I have had several people beta test the Electric Eel Wheel Mini 2. ÃÂÃÂ I'd like to give a huge shout-out to Tanya Cunningham, Sheryl Giles, and Joel Hall who all gave great feedback during the beta testing phase. ÃÂÃÂ Here are some quotes from the beta testers and images from them.   Tanya Cunningham  said:   ""I normally spin very thin singles, so I like quite a bit of speed, and a light touch on controlling the tension. The Mini 2 steps right up to that task and makes it a joy to spin lace weight singles. It also handles spinning a much heavier weight of yarn.""    ""I love how easy it is to change bobbins. The half-open bearing cradles allow you to very quickly and easily lift the entire flyer, remove the smaller bearing and slide one bobbin off and another one on.""    ""The unique base design has insets with keyholes. You can either clamp the wheel to a table, or easily create a custom base with screws that use the keyholes to secure the wheel to a weighted base.""    Sheryl Giles  said:  "" Much quieter. ÃÂÃÂ Great for people who like a carry-a-long craft project. ÃÂÃÂ Some spinners carry knitting or a drop-spindle because those travel well - now you can take your spinning wheel along! ÃÂÃÂ This sturdy little wheel is my new take along craft project. ÃÂÃÂ It's light, fits easily into my backpack and sets up in seconds so can spin wherever I go. ""   ""As current owners know, one of the best selling points for Electric Eel Wheels is the company that makes them. ÃÂÃÂ Maurice is committed to local production, affordable pricing, product development that is responsive to customer feedback, project transparency in the creation process and excellent customer service. ÃÂÃÂ Put another way, Maurice is really great to work with and is a perfect example of the advantages to buying from small businesses. ÃÂÃÂ So I not only love my EEW, I also feel great about supporting Dreaming Robots!""  ÃÂÃÂ      Spinning on the train       The results       Just finished another bobbin       Putting a bobbin worth of yarn onto a ball winder        Risks and challenges  I have done a lot of testing with this version of the Mini and several beta testers have also tested it.  The results have been very positive so I'm happy with the current design, and I donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t see a reason to make any significant changes to it for this Kickstarter.  There is always some risk when building hardware.  The major custom parts for this wheel are the plastic case, the motor, the circuit board, and some custom bent wires.  Everything except the plastic has final samples and a manufacturer is ready to make them, and the risks for these are low.  The plastic parts used in all my prototypes are 3d printed parts.  The final plastic parts will be a combination of milled and injection molded plastic.  I have used an injection company for over a dozen parts in the past.  These are the most complex set of parts I've ever done for injection molding, but I have a good relationship with this manufacturer.  They have already suggested several changes to my model which I have already incorporated into my 3d printed parts.  They assure me now that they can make plastic parts from these 3d models and have already given me their estimates.  This is certainly the area of biggest risk for delay, but I feel all my experience with injection molding and having a company I have used before for this kind of work helps mitigate the risk for serious problems or delays.  Final assembly is done by several contractors close to home near Boston, Massachusetts.  There is a risk that this assembly process becomes a bottleneck and causes delays if the orders far exceed my expectations.  However, because assembly of this spinning wheel is faster than any of my previous spinning wheels that means each assembler will be able to make more units per hour.  Still if the number of backers on Kickstarter is very large it could cause delays.  If the number of backers on Kickstarter is extremely large then I might need to look at other assembly options, which would lead to delays.  It is always possible for factors beyond my control to delay shipping, such as one of my suppliers going out of business, but these risks are minimized since I have been working with all my major suppliers for years.  This is not my first product, so I know about a lot of the pitfalls and have worked hard to avoid them. If you look at my previous four Kickstarter campaigns, you'll see three on time and one is still in progress, but itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s also on track.  That said, I will delay shipping if some issue with quality is found. I would rather delay shipping than ship a defective product.  Still it is my goal to get you this product on time."

But skin is much more complicated than that! In reality, most people experience several of those conditions (sometimes simultaneously) over the course of their lifetime. To truly understand whatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s going on, Atolla monitors three key measurements: moisture, oil and pH. These levels help us best tackle issues caused by any imbalance. ÃÂÃÂ    Moisture Level Test:  Without proper hydration, skin is more susceptible to redness, irritation, and unwanted hyper-pigmentation. Your moisture levels are used to design a formulation that keeps your skin hydrated.ÃÂÃÂ    Oil Level Test:  Your skinÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s oil protects it from the environment, but excess oil can lead to clogged pores, breakouts, and blackheads. Your oil levels are used to match you with ingredients that balance your skin.   pH Test:  Your skin's pH reflects how susceptible it is to bacteria, allergens, and pollution. By tracking your skin's pH, we make sure your skincare routine helps you stay in the optimal range of 4.5 - 5.5.

Thus, we are using machine learning to solve both the classification and recommendation problems. In other words, we use machine learning to create comprehensive skin archetypes based on all the factors that might affect someoneÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s skin.ÃÂÃÂ Based on that information, we have another machine learning model to predict how a personÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s skin will change to a particular formulation based on whether it work for people in the same skin archetype. As the Atolla community grows larger and people use the platform for longer, we will go one step further and predict skin outcomes based on the individual's skin, health, lifestyle and environment.

Be sure to choose DICEESÃÂÃÂ® : a smart, powerful and premium device, the reference of connected dice!   A little bit history of the origin of a classic dice  Dice game is without doubts, one of the oldest games in the world. We were already practicing it in India, during the Vedic period, 2 thousand years before Jesus Christ. Etruscan and roman citizens, Arabic countries and Spanish people loved to play with faith with those six faces. One of them was a flower drawn (ÃÂ<U+008E>z-zÃÂ<U+008E>hr, in ancient Arab) and, in latin, dice, the diceÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s game, and hazard, were designated with the word ÃÂÃÂ« Alea ÃÂÃÂ».As old as the world, the dice game has not much evolved since. But it was used for a lot of goals. We use it ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>nakedÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ for poker, or 421, or for an accessory in games like goose game, parcheesi, or backgammon, or even Monopoly, for making the pawns move forward.         Risks and challenges  All that needed to be done is to make that concept real. Our ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>makersÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ team composed of two designers and an electronics developper went quickly to work. Skills and long working hours transformed their dreams into a magical reality. ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>All had to be hosted in a very limited space: LEDs, battery, Bluetooth. It took thousand hours, prototyping, tests/mistakes, to give birth to a viable solution, the one seen in this videoÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ.  Now we need your help to develop the final device in mass production and more In-DICEES-App games. We believe in our project! We canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t wait for you to be a part of the DICEESÃÂÃÂ® community."

WHY MAGNIC MICROLIGHTS &amp; WEGA ARE GAME CHANGERS  Cyclists can't escape darkness: It returns every evening and sometimes even at daytime when passing tunnels. Battery lights seem comfortable with quick &amp; easy installation but there will be moments when the batteries are empty while you need them most. With Magnic Microlights you don't have to fear these moments because you have neverending light :   Benefits of Magnic Microlights:    Non Contact : You don't feel or hear them  No batteries - Neverending power    Strong enough to enlight the road ahead  Easy To InstallÃÂÃÂ   Cool ""invisible"" design: Compact size without adapters  Environmentally Friendly    Works with all bicycle models - WEGA for disc brakes    Don't fear the dark! The best time to cycle is whenever you want.   Magnic Microlights are theÃÂÃÂ worldÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s smallest non-contact dynamos, that are integrated together with electronics and lighting system in the brake shoes. In 2012 we presented our invention   Magnic Light   here on   Kickstarter  . Many ""experts"" did not believe this principle can work and believed our lights would be a fake but the MAGIC is clever usage of well known eddy current technology. With more than 17.000ÃÂÃÂ Magnic lights on the road via our successful   Magnic Light IC   campaign 2014 and our webshop we have proved that this sustainable, environment-friendly technology has the power to replace battery lights for bicycles.ÃÂÃÂ    The last 18 months we worked hard on the development of the Micro-Technology. With Magnic Microlights you can add non-contact dynamo light to your bicycle without need of extra adapters. If your bicycle has disc brakes choose Wega which has flexibility in four directions and fits to nearly all other bikes (except Vbrake/Canti systems), too.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ       3D Printed material, Fully functional contactless generator &amp; PCB Board electronic.        MAGNIC MICROLIGHT compared to WEGA- THE MICROLIGHT for disc brakes.  We named it WEGA because of the similarity with the stellar constellation Lyra and it's brightest star Wega       WEGA might be the most universal bike light on planet earth     HOW CAN THESE TINY LIGHTS BE STRONG?    Beneath generator technology one important aspect is the optimal choice of LED + lens which gives a big advantage compared to normal LED bicycle lights.For the Magnic Microlights we have chosen the newest extreme density - Cree LED (available since summer 2018): The most efficient high power LED with minimum size (1.6 mm x 1.6mm compared to 3.45mm x 3.45mm as used in many LED biycle lights).    What does this mean for Magnic Microlights?   Imagine you have a good bicycle light with 3,45mm x 3,45 mm LED, Lens of size 34,5 mm and 100 Lumen/Watt (These are quite excellent values for biycle lights).ÃÂÃÂ        Magnic Microlights don't have the strongest generators (because cyclists should not feel anything!) but they have the best light efficiency on the market: 200 Lumen/Watt !     With same current and tiny lenses MAGNIC MICROLIGHTS &amp; WEGA have twice the power of large high quality LED/lens applications.         2. WHICH REWARD FITS YOUR BIKE?  See the specification here and preorder on the top right of this page.                  MAGNIC LIGHT TEAM CLOTHING       See pictures in the gallery     3. LET ANIMATIONS EXPLAIN FUNCTIONSÃÂÃÂ   We have tested the current brakeshoe design from May to October on roadbikes &amp; mountainbikes with more than 3000 test kilometers. Although the stability of the prototype material (3d printed PLA) did not match that of the final product, there was noÃÂÃÂ  difference in braking performance compared to standard brakes that we otherwise use in training and everyday cycling.      See more details in the gallery...       TECHNICAL DATA     Our prototypes are less efficient than the final version because of lower generator power. We have to estimate the power of the final product based on the prototypes and our experience from the current Magnic Light version.          BRAKE LIGHT    Magnic Microlights have an effective brake light function. When you pull the brakes the distance between rim and generator decreases resulting in higher generator power and higher light output. The brake light works precisely and is a clear signal for subsequent traffic.     All Magnic Microlights have an integrated ""Brake Light""-function shown here: When you pull the brakes the lights brighten up which warns the driver behind you.      BEAM ADJUSTMENT    The design of front-&amp; rearlight allows to adjust the light beam regardless of the fork angle. Even for extreme bicycle frame geometry you can adjust the light beam towards the road.         BRAKE RUBBER REPLACEMENT    Worn brake pads can be exchanged easily as you would expect from standard brakes.ÃÂÃÂ          SHIFT MECHANISM    After longer usage your brakepads will loose up to 5mm material before you have to exchange them. The generator performance stongly depends on the rim distance so we have integrated an automatic shift mechanism to keep the distance between generator and rim constant small. An exchangeable shift-element moves the generator away from the rim and prevents grinding of the generator part.     After longer usage your brakepads will loose up to 5mm material before you have to exchange them. We have integrated an automatic shift mechanism to keep the distance between generator and rim constant which is important for performance of the system.      WEGA VISIBILITY         Wega is visible from both sides        See more details in the gallery...

HOW CAN YOUR BIKE GLOW AT NIGHT?  When we tried to assemble the ""perfect"" bicycle for this technology we were fascinated by the combination with phosphorescent wheels and decided to offer the Magnic Night Bike as reward, too.     Here you see the ""Glow ion the dark"" effect of the Magnic Night Bike wheels.    ÃÂÃÂ These are custom made wheels. In addition to the phosphorescent painting these are high quality welded aluminium rims which you only find on upper class roadbikes (like Shimano or Mavic). Even if ""normal"" rims work good with all Magnic Lights these rims are welded and don't have a magnetic rim joint.ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ      PREMIUM       The Magnic Night Bike is unique! You won't find something like this in any bike shop! Click on the image to reach the gallery.   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ      See more details in the gallery...     Four Magnic Microlights enlight the welded ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Glow in the dark"" rims. To keep your trousers clean when cycling we have replaced the standard chain by a Carbon belt drive from the leading company for bicycle belt drives :  Gates . Magnic Microlights need no cables so this bike follows the no-cables concept (except brake cables) but allows to shift between low and high speed gear with the automatic  Sturmey Archer hub .    CLASSIC    The CLASSIC version comes with a standard chain. You can turn the rear while and either us as free-wheel single speed bike or as FIXE with rigid hub.      See more details in the gallery...     6. FASCINATING TECHNOLOGY &amp; PHYSICS   The main technology of our lights is based on eddy current induction. ÃÂÃÂ          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.      Play                                      Replay with sound          Play with   sound                   00:00    00:00                                             The core part is the worldÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s smallest contact- and frictionless bicycle dynamo, that is integrated together with the electronic and the lighting system in the brake shoe of a calliper brake. The world-wide patented technic developed by the German company Magnic Innovations is based onÃÂÃÂ  eddy current induction: a magnetic wheel in a generator separated from the bicycle rim by a narrow air gap induces temporary magnetic fields even in non-magnetic aluminium bicycle rims when the bicycle rim is moving. This leads to the magnetic wheel rotating contactlessly as if by magic.   Neither batteries nor external cables, further fittings or spoke-magnets are necessary. Only the brake shoes have to be exchanged for microlight - brake shoes, so that the maintenance only involves the exchange of worn brake pads after thousands of kilometres. The included brake pads are compatible with other standard brake pads of other manufacturers as available in every cycle shop.    Eddy current        Eddy currents (I, red) induced in a conductive metal plate (C) as it moves to right under a magnet (N)     The key is so-called  eddy current  technology : Energy is drawn from the rotating bicycle wheels without any physical contact, and thus without friction. Instead, eddy currents, created by strong magnets, generate electricity to power the lights: When the wheel spins, magnets inside the generator induce eddy currents with corresponding magnetic fields in the wheel, which in turn interact with the magnets in the generator. The resulting electricity will power your lights indefinitely without any environmentally harmful batteries or cumbersome cables.  While the previous larger Magnic Lights were equipped with two LEDs (one for stand light) Magnic Microlights have just one LED which is fed by ultra-high efficient Mosfet rectifiers.       7. HOW THE FUTURE CAN BE SMART  The SMART VERSION presented here can only be realized within the rangeof this project if we reach a very high stretch goal of 500.000 ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬. We don't expect to reach this goal but present what is possible if we do. (In case this amount is reached the reward for the SMART VERSION will be available in the rewards section and you can switch if you like).ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  Reason for the high stretch goal: High cost for final development of bluetooth control software &amp; electronics. At the moment we have implemented the main features with prototypes based on the electronic boards and microprocessors of the larger  MAGNIC LIGHT IC  version.    Turn SignalsÃÂÃÂ         The Smart version comes with a cool novelty : A blink system for turn signals without any additional switches and even without a smartphone. How does it work? If you tap the brake lever the distance between Microlights and rim changes which can be detected in the lights (even without braking). A double-tap is our signal for the blinker: If you double-tap the right brake lever the rear lights detect the signal and via bluetooth to the front lights- so that lights on the right side are blinking. Correspondingly this works on the left side. ÃÂÃÂ     NavigationÃÂÃÂ     Navigation is similar to the turn signals - but here you are guided and need our Smartphone App for navigation: Lights are controlled by the navigation app and start to blink on the left or right side when you have to turn left/right. Put your smartphone in your bag and let the lights guide your way.ÃÂÃÂ     Speed Data Transmission    ÃÂÃÂ   The smart Magnic Microlights are equipped with a Bluetooth LE microcontroller which easily detects the rotation speed of your wheel from the incoming current. Via smartphone or Bluetooth LE compatible speedometer  you can receive speed data for display or further processing. This feature replaces Bluetooth LE speed sensors which have the same function but need extra mounting and extra batteries.ÃÂÃÂ     Crash detection with emergency call    ÃÂÃÂ   This feature requires some future development and is still theory. In case of a crash generators will stop abruptly. We need some test data but we are confident to be able to detect a crash situation reliably which can be sent to the smartphone in order to make an emergency call. ÃÂÃÂ     Configuraton for Stand light and more    ÃÂÃÂ   We will offer different stand light patterns which can be set via Smartphone App. Additionally it will be possible to switch the internal orientation of the lights (for example for correct turn signals if your left and right brake levers deviate from standard installations).       8.ÃÂÃÂ HOW WE DO POLITICS: GERMAN STVZO ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    Nov. 5th 2018, UPDATE    Concering German STVZO approval for our new lighting technology some frustrating years are behind us.But we did not give up and we achieved that the highest responsable committees were invloved in new rules for STVZO approval concerning our technology.Today we were informed that our main ideas could influence the new legislation which shall pass theVerkehrsauschuss (Committee of Transport) of the German Bundestag next month.We believe that the German rules are too complex and old fashioned and hopefully our efforts helpto go in the right direction.For our systems (Magnic Light IC, and Magnic Microlights) this is good news because we finally can adjust our lights concerning to these rules. For our technology here are the three most important new rules concerning Magnic Light:ÃÂÃÂ    For lighting systems consisting of two separate lights (left &amp; right) the total amount of light needs to exceed the minimum of 10 lux (and not each single light).(Otherwise our lights should have been twice as bright as the required minimum value at 15km/hwhile they easily do at &gt;25 km/h)ÃÂÃÂ   For lens systems the ""brightest area"" can replace brightest point of the light distribution (which is the measurement point for the light distribution with respect to ""anti-blinding"" characteristics). The highest point within such an the ""brightest area"" can be taken as measurement point nowwhich previously gave room for ambiguity.-ÃÂÃÂ   The German bicycle light lobby wanted to have a new rule that prohibits dynamos with less than 50% efficiency.Sounds reasonable but measurements for ""Micro""-system are very complex (and expensive) because the result can be distorted by air resistance, wheel material, bearings, .. much more than these parametersinfluence large systems (hub dynamos).We could not stop this new rule but at least we could achieve that is is not necessary to proveefficiency charateristics for micro-dynamos below 1,3 Watts. (Background: The rule shall prevent cyclists from exerting too much effort for their dynamo lights-Consequently we should forbid non-aerodynamic clothin for cyclists in future because this costs much more energy ;.) I want to address this to the German Minister for Environment, Svenja Schulze at the Awards Ceromony forthe Bundespreis Ecodesign on Nov. 26th in Berlin.

OUR BACKGROUND  Cycling is an important part of our live- not just as a business. Below you see images from ""The Making of"" video &amp; photo material for this project. Whenever we are cycling Magnic Lights &amp; Magnic Microlights are with us (Cycling to Calais, in Berlin,ÃÂÃÂ on straw balesÃÂÃÂ ...)      See details in the gallery ...      OUR MISSION      We all just have this one live-  why take the risk and cycle without light?    Without lighting, cyclists risk their lives in the dark - but those on the road with battery lights will soon be left in the dark when the journey takes too long or the batteries are no longer full. For those who do not want to mount heavy dynamos, use batteries or lay cables, we've launched two Kickstarter projects with our non-contact Magnic Lights, which feel like battery lighting without having to exchange or change batteries. Magnic Microlights can't be turned off at daylight and we are convinced this makes sense from a safety point of view: With lights on your visibilty increases significantly which means a great deal of safety.   Battery Lights are not the option:     Family team      Dirk Strothmann (Management, CAD &amp; Software Design,...)

Here you see our most important partners and coworkers:ÃÂÃÂ     VTS Elektronik Gmbh, FÃÂÃÂ¼rstenau /GER   (Electronic Circuit Design, PCB Board Design &amp; Automated/ Roboter PCB Board Assembly), Coil Winding &amp; AssemblyÃÂÃÂ   HAICHENG MOLD, Shenzhen /CHN Tooing &amp; Injection mold processing    Shenzhen Hill optical technology ,CHN , Lens development &amp; production         12. ILLEGAL COPIES &amp; PLAGIARISM  On the web you can find several illegal copies of our patented technology.ÃÂÃÂ      Patent infringing Magnic Light plagiarism     The sellers don't care for patents and they also fool the customers because their produtcs don't work as promised (and will fail completely after ~30 hours usage because the internal batteries will be empty).     Our original Magnic Lights with real functionality. You can buy them directly in our webshop (Shipment within 2 days)    Watch our analysis of two nasty Magnic Light copies:      13. PAYMENT WITHOUT CREDIT CARD / BEZAHLUNG OHNE KREDITKARTE  UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzer aus Deutschland kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen auch per Lastschrift bezahlen. FinanzierungsbeitrÃÂÃÂ¤ge werden erst bei erfolgreicher Finanzierung nach Ablauf einer Zwei-Wochen Frist abgebucht.  Besteht ein Risiko, wenn das Projektziel nicht erreicht wird?: Nein- Nach Projektende wird der Betrag nur dann eingezogen, wenn das Projektziel erreicht wurde.  14. FAQ     Do Magnic Microlights fit to my bike?   Yes- if you have ""Standard"" rim brakes (Caliper, Vbrake, Cantilver brakes). Even for disc brake systems we have a clamp adapter solution- but this is just for light and does not provide brake light.    Do Magnic Microlights work with Carbon rims?   No- we need a metal rim. Aluminum is best. Magnesium works, too .ÃÂÃÂ    I want to add mutiple rewards to my pledge  . Is this possible?   Yes- This is ok for all available rewards except limited rewards (otherwise the limitation fails)ÃÂÃÂ  and complete bicycles (high shipping cost). Just add the amount for additional rewards to your pledge (without additional shipping cost). After project termination you will receive a survey where you can specify your desired combination.ÃÂÃÂ     Do I have to exchange brake pads often?   No- ""Normal"" cyclists exchange their bicycles more frequently than the brake pads because these usually last for more than 5000 kilometers. Hardcore bikers have to exchange the brake pads from time to time.  ÃÂÃÂ      15. PHOTO GALLERIES (FREE FOR MEDIA USAGE)     Magnic Microlights    Wega    Magnic Night Bike- Premium    Magnic Night Bike - ClassicÃÂÃÂ     Making of    Award Ceremony German Federal Design Award    Action Gallery                 Risks and challenges  With two successful Magnic Light Crowdfunding campaigns we have proven that our technology works as promised and that we are able to handle production and shipment. In the meantime we have received several awards worldwide patent grants for the Magnic Light technology. The last months we worked hard to make the Magnic Microlights ready for production and tested them thoroughly.   The Smart version will only be available, if we pass the high stretch goal. In contrast to the other rewards the smart version is not ready for production and needs some more development. For this reason delivery of the Smart version will take nearly one year (only in case the stretch goal will be reached).  We have analyzed production steps and risks carefully and don't want to promise more than we can deliver. This means that the majority of the rewards can't be shipped before May 2019.  In the project plan we have taken into account delays due to initial mistakes but it is clear that this is an estimation based on our previous experiences. We will communicate all production steps via Kickstarter updates in detail."

ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s no secret that standing at work is great for upping output. So after researching productivity-boosting practices, we decided to take standing desks to greater heights. ÃÂÃÂ        What resulted is an award-winning* smart desk thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s built with selected materials and advanced technology ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094> allowing you to work at your best with ease and convenience.ÃÂÃÂ   Meet the desk that works for you.

Set it to your ideal height between 25 and 51 inches, and work in a way that suits you.                    But itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s the Integrated LED Smart Lamp desktop unit that makes this smart desk so,  well , smart.ÃÂÃÂ        With sensory technology, it flashes a gentle prompt if your posture needs correcting or youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve been at your desk too long.ÃÂÃÂ After all, working smarter means working healthier.             And should you leave your desk for ten minutes, the light turns off automatically and turns on again on your return.ÃÂÃÂ             Additional features include both wireless charging and a USB port for your cell phone.     Charging can only be used when the Smart Lamp is plugged into a power source    And to top it off, the Smart Lamp is movable after charging, meaning you can further personalize your work environment.            Where other standing desks are bulky, rigid and user-unfriendly, the Magic Desk is ergonomically designed to bring comfort, style and simplicity to the modern workplace.       With three classic colors (black, white and walnut) and two length sizes (58"" and 47) to choose from, all of which are made with dense medium-density fiberboard, the Magic Desk makes a fine addition to any home or work space.ÃÂÃÂ                       Standing while working isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t just a fad. Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf and Ernest Hemingway wrote their best works standing up.       Although we canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t promise youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll write a classic novel on one of our Magic Desks, you can at least improve your productivity and health.  Start with productivity. Standing at work boosts motivation and output in ways that hunching over a desk does not. A recent experiment from Texas A&amp;M University found that employees who used standing desks were  46% more productive than those at traditional desks . ÃÂÃÂ        As for health, even if you regularly exercise, research shows that long periods of inactivity sitting in the office are detrimental to health no matter how much time you spend at the gym after work. ÃÂÃÂ   Moreover, most of us are familiar with the back aches and pains caused by bad posture from sitting at our desks. Standing, on the other hand,  helps maintain good posture and counts as physical activity . ÃÂÃÂ   No wonder Dickens, Woolf and Hemingway all worked this way. ÃÂÃÂ                  Have you ever wanted to move objects with gestures like a wizard?     Wu Junfeng    37ÃÂÃÂ°C Smart Home designer Wu Junfeng certainly did. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s how he came up with the concept for a contactless-controlled standing desk that could be raised and lowered easily.  ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Actually my first thought was only about designing a desk that its height can be controlled by gestures,ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ Mr Wu explained.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Then the idea evolved into a comprehensive workplace solution: how could the desk help maximize your work performance? Could it also play a role in caring for your health, to deliver messages for you actively?ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        One idea soon spread to others. Mr Wu decided to include a desktop unit that would gently prompt users to correct their posture and take regular breaks. ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>I think the healthcare Magic Desk provides is one of the factors that make it unique,ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ he added. ÃÂÃÂ   And by being a standing desk user himself, Mr Wu knew how they raised productivity. Since he started standing while working, he found himself more likely to walk around and talk with colleagues, collaborating and bouncing ideas off them, as he was already standing up. ÃÂÃÂ        The result of his ideas? A complete workplace solution that not only promoted healthy working habits, but also could encourage everyone to work smarter. ÃÂÃÂ   ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s the magic of Mr WuÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s Magic Desk.  About Us  Founded in July 2017, 37ÃÂÃÂ°C Smart Home is a team of specialists with a shared goal to create the perfect work space in and out of the office.ÃÂÃÂ   We do this by creating products that are as clever as they are stylish, striking a balance between smart technology and aesthetics.  In practice that means fewer buttons and wires for a better design ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094> all without compromising on the intelligence of our products.                Risks and challenges  The main challenge of launching a product on Kickstarter is making and fulfilling the product within the specified timeframe. By having our own factory (as opposed to outsourcing), we are able to increase the production capacity within a very short timespan. This also offers us more flexibility production-wise.   Another advantage of having our own factory is that it enables us to offer competitive pricing, as fewer external parties are involved.    Lastly, this full control over the production process allows us to closely monitor our products' quality, as the production process can constantly be monitored and tweaked where required. Because of this, we are able to try out innovative production techniques which would otherwise be impossible.   Where we have to work with third parties, we have always opted for the best partners and logistics teams available for each region in order to meet deadlines."

SABA Freiburg 11    If you're looking on the well known selling platforms for ""Magic Eye"" than you'll find not only a lot of tubes but also offers of VU meter kits. But here as against the most available offers you need not to supply all the voltages (normally 6 V and 250 V), you do not need to build a case, solder adapter wires for the tube's connections, have only a mono display or only one tube type which can be fitted, etc...ÃÂÃÂ      Mr. Nixie has taken all these kits, put them in a pot, added a hefty dose of the legendary Mr. Nixie Magic, and finally the  Magilyzer EM800  was created.  Absolute unique on the (DIY) world market !      Magilyzer EM800 Prototype    The  Magilyzer EM800  is an analog audio spectrum analyzer, based around an analog analyzer chip. It offers the display of six selective audio bands: 63 Hz, 150 Hz, 330 Hz, 1 kHz, 3.3 kHz and 10 kHz.ÃÂÃÂ   As an extra feature, you can mix the signal of a build in microphone to the display, to use the Magilyzer as a stand-alone device when no audio source is connected (as done in the video, standing in front of Amazon's Echo).      Magilyzer EM800 Prototype    The  Magilyzer EM800  operates with six EM800 Magic Eye tubes and has two RCA stereo in- and outputs (for easy daisy chaining the device within an existing audio path) and also two 1/8"" TRS jacks for simple connecting your MP3 player, mobile phone plus headphone for listening etc.ÃÂÃÂ   Both signals (RCA and 1/8"" TRS are only internal mixed and do not affect each other.  The  Magilyzer EM800  uses no digital processor or FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation); so the display is stepless and fully in realtime.  What is an audio spectrum analyzer?     DIY LED spectrum analyzer, found on Youtube    You surely know a VU meter, which shows the level of an audio signal, often build with LEDs on the DIY market.ÃÂÃÂ   The  Magilyzer EM800  now separates this audio signal into six selective bands and show their special audio level within this frequency band:    63 Hz  = Low Bass (e.g. Bassdrum)     150 Hz  = Mid Bass (e.g. Bassguitar)    330 Hz  = Low Mid (near concert pitch of the most musican instruments)    1 kHz  = Mid of voice frequency (e.g. the ""beep"" sound for indecent words in interviews)     3.3 kHz  = Presence (e.g. ""sch"" in the word  Schedule  or the imitated sound of a steam locomotive)    10 kHz  = Heights (e.g. ""ssss"")   And as an absolute unique feature, the  Magilyzer EM800  displays the level not on ""ordinary"" LED display (as seen on the sample picture above) or VFD display or on a computer screen or even in an App of your mobile phone but on  six EM800 Magic Eye tubes  made in the end of the 60's by TELEFUNKEN / Germany.

Selectable audio channel (right / both / left) for display.  Build-in microphone signal can be mixed.  63 Hz, 150 Hz, 330 Hz, 1 kHz, 3.3 kHz, 10 kHz spectrum level are displayed on 6 x EM800 Magic Eye tubes  Positive grid bias for the tubes adjustable for a kind of ""screen saver"" when no signal is applied.

Soldering station and fine electronic solder.  Multimeter to check the generated voltages.  Electronic tools.  A loupe may be helpful    TX8/10 (Torx), PH1/2 and mini slotted screwdriver  6 x EM800 Magic Eye tubes      Wouldn't it be the ultimate Christmas present for any tube audio enthusiast?   Now you have the opportunity to ""capture"" this unique DIY kit for an absolute special Christmas price.     These are the parts what you need to assemble     Here's a part of the schematic for the exact input configuration      only the black coloured parts needs to be assembled manually (through hole components)     Some words about the ""unkown"" EM800 tubes from TELEFUNKEN           These tubes were the absolutely final development of Magic Eye tubes in 1966. They has been primary designed as a channel-no. display on the upcomming first generation of European colour TV sets.  However, the time was just too late for preamplifier tubes as in the end of the 60's transistors came up to be used in the tuner stages of the TV sets and tubes become extinct (except for the picture tube for sure and their high voltage supply).  This very first production batch of the TELEFUNKEN EM800 tubes were comercial never used in many devices. Radiomuseum.org for example reports only from three GRUNDIG colour TV sets from 1967 and two DYNACHORD power amplifiers which has used this tube (and for sure the Magilyzer first version).     Result for ""EM800"" tube search on Radiomuseum.org    So the EM800 have never left Germany or Europe, are very unknown in the rest of the world and has spend their last 50 years unused in German warehouses.ÃÂÃÂ   On the other hand,  these tubes has been a big improvement  of the well known EM84 / EM87 (6FG6 / 6HU6) or their clones 6E2 (China) and 6E3-P (Russia)  as the illuminated screen started here from bottom  (like a real VU meter)  and not from the middle.   The EM800 are still available in thousands of pcs. for a resonable price.    Here   you can read the German datasheet of the EM800   How hot will the aparatus run after two weeks of continuous operation (!!!)              You're asking about the lifespan of these EM800 tubes?   Me too, many years before ;-) for sure. So I have created a ""NixieCam"" on my old homepage:     Screenshot from the NixieCam in 2011    Left and right hand on the screen you'll see four of my ""Magic Eye Winkers""; Video  here . I kept all these devices (incl. Nixieclock ""Marcel"" and the NixieTherm ) powered up for one year ~ 8,800 hrs continuously.   The left hand ""Winkers"" are equipped with an EM84 and EAM86, the right hand Winkers with EM81 and EM80.But every three month I need to replace the right hand EM's with new tubes as they became really blind and you could see nothing more from the illuminated screen on the webcam. The left hand EM's have not lost any noticable brightness during this one year stress test.   For sure - as you might also see - they are using not such a ""fine"" green shining phosphor as the older versions on the right hand, but this ""more modern bluish green"" increases the livespan a lot.   BTW: It looks that this is the same phosphor which is used in the modern VFD displays...      Risks and challenges  The new Magilyzer EM800 is a further development and improvement of the first DIY version (see it on  www.Nixiekits.eu ) which is now nearly sold out. Therefore are new batch needs to be designed and ordered. The SMD pre-assembled PCBs are already arrived. Now I need this crowdfounding project to order for an affordable price the electrical / mechanical parts and the EM800 tubes to have the kits ready for shipping just in time for Christmas; therefore Express shipping for backers outside EU in the 1st December week is recommended to compensate the shipping delay during Christmas business on customs clearence on ""ordinary"" postal service (up to 21 days incl. shipping time).

It could be anything, big or small.ÃÂÃÂ Like flossing, reading, writing, doing yoga, eating churros, doing sit ups (while eating churros), practicing an instrument or learning a new word.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        But take it from someone who's never managed to keep a New Year's resolution: making commitments is easy.  Keeping them is what is hard.   The Every Day Calendar has a non-volatile memory, so even if it loses power or if your turn it off, it'll remember what days were lit up I keep my habits, I get to tap that day to light it up. It's like getting a gold star sticker, but way less sticky.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        How to get started with the Every Day Calendar   1.  Read this list. You're doing great so far.   1.5  Get an Every Day Calendar. (Using the ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ .5 ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ somehow makes this feel less pushy)   2.  Set a goal for yourself. ""Being healthier"" is a great intention but let's make it more tangible than that. I struggle a lot with stress, so my goal was to meditate every day.   3.  Lower the bar. Make it something you can do even on the most chaotic of days. You can always do more on days when you have more time. My goal was at least ten minutes of meditation a day.ÃÂÃÂ    4.  Hang the Every Day Calendar in your home, office, workshop, cavern, laboratory, castle, barn or boat. Just make sure that it's someplace where you see it every day. The Every Day Calendar is 0% internet connected, so no apps, wifi, bluetooth or computer programs are needed to set it up. Just plug it into the wall and you're ready to go.   5-ÃÂ¢<U+0088><U+009E>.  Live your best life with the Every Day Calendar.ÃÂÃÂ        The Every Day Calendar also works for tracking non-daily habits like watering plants, changing your contacts, calling your granddad or for period tracking.  What's insideÃÂÃÂ   You know printed circuit boards, those things that are in every electronic product you've ever used? If you don't, I get it. Printed circuit boards, or PCBs, are mostly tucked away on the inside, and you don't really get to see or interact with them as a consumer.  For the Every Day Calendar, we did it the other way around: we took the regular circuit board that everyone else is trying to hide, and designed it to be the front display.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        What ensued was a really fun design challenge that pushed printed circuit board technology to the limits in terms of size and functionality. The hexagon pattern is made out of gold-immersed copper, a common circuit board feature that's not usually used for aesthetics, but things like solder pads and traces.ÃÂÃÂ         Designing the pattern for the front display   Instead of having costly mechanical components like switches and buttons, the Every Day Calendar uses capacitive touch. And without solder masks, circuit boards themselves are translucent. That is what allows the LEDs to shine through when you light up a day.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   The Every Day Calendar has a non-volatile memory, so even if it loses power or if your turn it off, it'll remember what days were lit up.        Testing different color LEDs and translucence  ÃÂÃÂ   Open source (and there's a secret programming port too)  I get that people might want to pick this thing apart. And that you're probably one of those people since you're reading this section. That's why we're open-sourcing the schematics for the Every Day Calendar, and putting a USB programming port on the back.

And obviously, the  Every Day Calendar itself . Keyholes in the back to make hanging easy (after a little bit of futzing, let's be honest)ÃÂÃÂ   How is this calendar different from other calendars?ÃÂÃÂ   As for a lot of things, it's all about what you put into it. Without you having a clear intention, the Every Day Calendar is just that: a pretty calendar. But combined with a goal for a daily habit that you want to add your life it's a powerful way to keep yourself on track.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ         No, I'm not above using cute dogs to sell this calendar   Thank you  There are so many people who have helped make the dream of the Every Day Calendar a reality. The list is long, but I don't want to sound like a drunk uncle at a wedding so I'll keep it short.   Engineering team ÃÂÃÂ         Cedric Bosch,  Ray Kampmeier, Jake Zimmer,  Ross Huber  and Marcos Ramirez: you made this project feel like a party. But one of those parties where you mostly talk about capacitive touch sensors, product distributors and safety standards. Thank you for joining me on this journey. Much more to come.   Video production ÃÂÃÂ        Brett Sims, of  Alkali Productions,  for helping make this video way prettier than we could do by ourselves. And for wearing shirts with great prints.   Music   Karaoke-ing praises at the top of my lungs to Jon Reichardt for composing music for this video and a huge shout out toÃÂÃÂ  Chymes  for their song  Clouds.  You can check out more of their music  here . My karaoke album is yet to be released - but thank you for asking.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ         You. Yes,    you    Mostly I want to thank you. Even if you don't end up buying the Every Day Calendar, just coming over here and checking it out means a lot to me. And it takes a lot of trust to believe that someone who's mostly known for building useless things actually could make a difference. But the Every Day Calendar has made a huge difference for me, and I hope it could make one for you too.  Here's a gold star for getting to the bottom of this page. That one's free for today. Get the calendar if you want more.ÃÂÃÂ    Over and out, ÃÂÃÂ                 Risks and challenges  We are still looking into manufacturing partners and things are fairly open-ended until then. The trickiest part is the two giant circuit boards since it's a bit out of the ordinary, but there are still plenty of manufacturers who have that capability. We'll keep you posted along the way!"

Crewbands are  solar powered , improve both the connection quality to the app as well as the working range and are equipped with a  smart water sensor.  The technical design and circuit board have been  optimised  for energy efficiency, connection stability and daily use.       When spending your day on a boat, preferably in the sun, you might not want to constantly be reminded of possible mishaps. This is why we tried to minimise the size of the Crewband and keep it light. You will be agile and free, but always safe - this is our premise.       We also wanted to create a device that can be worn 24/7, without first having to attach it to your safety vest or jacket. The energy efficiency we achieved allows for up to 2 days of complete darkness, after which you might want to charge your Crewbands using any light source available to you - even a lamp will suffice.       Want to try the system first?  Our apps are free of charge, so you can download and try them out any time. If you want to test the system first, simply connect to your fitness tracker or smartwatch. That's right, you can also use them as safety wristband. Of course, the connection stability and range will depend on the hardware you use, and we cannot speak for how good it will be.  There is a solution for this as well, your very own Crewband.              The start of Team Crewbands.  After thorough testing in rivers, lakes and the sea, we decided to talk to professional sailors and fellow developers.ÃÂÃÂ Their feedback encouraged us to proceed and make this product real.  During the Vienna Race of the  Austrian Sailboat Racing Series , we showed the prototype to sailing professionals and enthusiasts. They did not only like our product, but also our presentation - especially the part where they got to throw one of us in the water constantly.

To gain more real life experience with the quality and reliability of a Crewband, the next step is to conduct a big test round with sailing experts over several month in different conditions. This may lead to insights that make changes to the current version necessary.  However, we know that life is not always fully predictable and there might be unforeseen troubles waiting for us on the road to mass production. We have a great network of industry partners and other startups that have manufactured products before. We will further leverage this network to ensure we can bring our Crewbands to life and into your hands.  The main challenges we see are:  Bluetooth Range: To prevent false alarms, a good bluetooth connection reliability is key. We will put a lot of effort into optimising the connection range in specialised laboratories to ensure a good user experience.  Watertightness: Packing so much technology in so little space at this price point challenges our goal to make each Crewband safe to dive with up to 10m. We put a lot of effort into assuring you will anyway be able to wear the Crewbands 24/7, even if you dive for the anchor.  Certifications  To sell Crewbands in Europe, North America and other selected regions, we need to comply, amongst others, with CE and FCC certifications. This process is complex and can potentially require more time than expected.  With your help we can and will make it happen!"

Take a look through our lenses, and see the super high resolution for yourself.                The short explanation for why we deliver 4X the resolution is all because of the optics.On VR, the content is splitted in two,  one picture for each eye. So, even a smartphone with a resolution of 1920x 1080, will only provide 960x 1080. But then the aspect ratio is completely off. In order to keep the aspect ratio (usually 16:9 for most 2D-content), the image has to be shrunk (as shown below to the left) to ~960x540, which turns into 1/4 of the smartphones original resolution. With MagiMask however, we're able to give you the full resolution (picture to the right).                  The objects are optimized for computer vision, which ensures a stable tracking of your models, and you can also use the MagiDice as a controller for interacting with the digital world.            So the MagiMask also works perfectly as a MovieMask, making it the perfect gadget for all the movie lovers out there. Based on our unique lens technology, it works out-of-the-box forNetflix, HBO, Hulu, Youtube, and all your exisiting apps. Just plug and play!       The MagiMask is actually based on our previous product, the MovieMask, which we have sold and delivered over 10.000 units to over 70 countries so far, and that currently sells in retail for $129.                                                                 AR scenes shot with GoPro through MagiMask               README (for Developers/Creators)ÃÂÃÂ          Why   Augmented reality reveals a new world of possibilities and now is the time to join - creating the standards of our new reality. With MagiMask and MagiTools we are giving you the starting point to unleash your creativity and participate in a passionate community. By using this platform, you can be sure that there will be people using your creations in AR, and that we together can shape the future of digital interactions.    How   The MagiTools are specially designed to make the transition between our reality and augmented reality as natural as possible. Reaching out to get to know more about an object is an ultimate path of least resistance, thus letting the user to immerse themselves in your experience. The patterns of MagiTools have been optimised through several iterations to be best understood by the image recognition software. We will also give all the developers access to our code in order to enable easy interactions with the MagiTools, e.g. by using the dice as a controller, and so forth.   Cooperation with Manomotion - control technology with your hands      Testing Manomotion through MagiMask in Stockholm    Thanks to Manomotion, we are now also able to control technology with our hands. It is one step closer to Iron Man studio and a more accessible HoloLens. With ManomotionÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s SDK you can create applications where your hand movements are recognised by the camera on your phone.

WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve made a FAQ section below. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be adding new FAQs as we go along, and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be keeping you up to date with Kickstarter Updates, messages, and via the Comment wall. And please, feel free to reach out to us - we are always happy to help!      Risks and challenges  The team is fully devoted to making MagiMask a success, but we are of course aware that there are risks connected with creating something completely new. We are a team of second time Kickstarter-creators (first product was called MovieMask, with an older generation version of the same optical principle). We have shipped thousands of products to over 70 countries - where around 98% was delivered on time (and the last 2% was delayed in the mail due to peak Christmas season last year). We feel confident that we can deliver to you on time this campaign as well and understand the frustration that can arise when projects donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t deliver on time.   Even though we have a functional prototype now with close to finished aesthetics, our american Quality Control-partner has not yet finished their report on the MagiMask. If they require different processes in the manufacturing that our production partner offers, this could lead to delay or, worst case scenario, the MagiMask as of today is not fit for mass-production.  The software that we are developing in-house and in collaboration with 3rd party developers are to be considered as demoes until we have an app on the iOS and Play store. Nonetheless, we will work on making a comprehensive list of all existing apps that can be downloaded at the time of receiving the product.  Last time we also got a lot of questions regarding customs. As of October 16th 2018, backers from USA and many other countries pay no customs for our price point, but other countries does. Please check out your local custom rules is this is important to you as we will not pay this.  We have also heard and spoken with Kickstarter-campaigns that were more successful than our funding goal, reached them, but still got troubles due to the logistics. From our interviews, this includes unreliable business partners, miscalculating costs and setting out a distribution system that is not fit for the scale of the demand. We plan to use the same production partners, quality control partners and logistics partners as we have used before and believe this will reduce the risk compared to first-time business relationships.   Please contact  kickstarter@ludenso.com  for any inquiries or tips for improvement!  Best regards The MagiMask-team"

Please be careful about any FAKE websites. Kickstarter and CrowdOx.com (our post-campaign pledge management platform) are the only official channels for backing Footloose.                                     Cleaning litter boxes is certainly an unpleasant routine. But what was your feeling last time when confronted a toilet un-flushed? Gotcha! I mean, felines have a well-earned reputation as immaculate creatures. They need a clean toilet just like we do.  Footloose is invented to keep your cats' treasure-burying ground always clean. Each time after they finish their business, Footloose starts an 8-min countdown and then initiates a cleaning cycle that funnels all wastes into a tightly-sealed receptacle. All you've to do is to discard the waste bag once in a while.       OmniClean Technology  Existing contraptions have failed what they're built for. Most of them break down within a year of purchase. While cleaning, they cause a lot of waste debris or even get themselves polluted. It feels like you would rather just scoop the litter at the outset.  So we developed OmniClean technology that actually works. The meticulous fusion of hive-style sieve, curvy funnel, fine-tuned turning speed and powerful torque is a result of our unwavering engineering pursuit. Then with a little blessing of the gravitational force, it turns the arduous frustration into a hassle-free pleasure.            A Zero-Compromise Solution  Footloose is a real life hack that embodies our zero-compromise ethos. We invented this system so that you can say goodbye to scooping without compromising on other aspects.                 Footloose is the smartest littering robot you can ever imagine. SiftAutonomy algorithms give it the intelligence to recognize each critter in multi-cat households, distinguish litter from cats, detect its perimeter and monitor waste level. To enable that, Footloose includes 3 weight sensors, 4 position gauges, a 360ÃÂÃÂ° millimeter-wave transceiver, 2 infrared sensors and 2 powerful computing cores.       The Wireless Litter Box System  After unboxing, pair up Footloose with your home WiFi via Smart Config. It'll stay connected thus you can control it in the Petato App wherever you're. Tweak settings that suit you better and do update firmware for new features in the future.                                                                                               According to veterinarians, potty behavior is a barometer of health. The advantage of scooping is probably that you can check the waste to see whether your cat is in a good shape. But this is the one thing people always ignore until something bad happens.  With ActiveTrack, we can now proactively monitor cats' physical conditions. Footloose indicates you when there is an anomaly. Some symptoms are difficult to spot by human eyes but can hardly hide from the robots. For example, increased attempts to urinate with small volumes is barely noticeable by human but can be a serious sign of urinary problems.       All data is streamed to your smartphone for reference at any time. We can't generalize a Ph.D thesis topic into several lines here but at the bottom line, these data points are highly helpful for diagnosis when you visit a vet's office.            The debate over open or hooded box is unsettled. Though every pet cat is different, it can be inferred from their outdoor equivalents that the need for fresh air, large space, and relatively sheltered spot is universal. It's this cat-centric philosophy that gives birth to Footloose's form factors.       Good for Small or Old Cats  To facilitate smaller or elder cats with reduced agility, a doorstep is provided. Additionally, the upper surface of the receptacle is engraved with a cascade pattern that serves as a step for in and out.       Sympathy for The Weaker  If you've two or more cats, there may be a hierarchy in their society. Those who are less dominant may often get harassed while toileting. However, in the raised chamber, they look taller hence are less prone to a fight put up by another aggressive cat.       100% Safe &amp; Secure  All the current self-cleaning litter boxes have one common issue: while the mechanical parts are moving, cats can still get inside, unnoticed. In edge cases, this even leads to fatal injuries, especially for petite cats or other small pets such as ferrets.  Footloose is totally safe &amp; secure thanks to three layers of protection. As our signature design, the chamber opening closes while spinning, which prevents cats from entering. More proactively, a millimeter-wave detector picks up any motion of pet or kid within the 30 cm range. It stops the machine right away and resumes after the perimeter is cleared. Lastly, if a tiny critter manages to get in from above, the agile weight sensors can pick up even the slightest change and alert the owner immediately.ÃÂÃÂ                                       Litter box odor is annoying. But Footloose is here to help. Physically, the waste receptacle is concealed as airtight as possible. There won't be any waste exposed in the open air. On the other hand, the stench you smell is mainly ammonia and some sulfide compounds - they get decomposed by a deodorizing unit.       The process is known as photocatalysis, same technology used by  NASA  in space missions. During the process, UV light energizes the catalyst (mainly titanium dioxide, TiO2) rested in the porous zeolite materials, triggering chemical reactions that neutralize the odor at molecular level, and producing primarily carbon dioxide and water as byproducts.       Footloose works with any cat litter that clumps, as well as silica gel crystals. Our ingenious hexagonal sifting holes are designed to allow litter of different sizes and shapes to pass through efficiently. They're optimized such that no litter will be left out or wasted. When litter returns to the chamber, the pliable sieve lets it fall gently, which minimizes dust.  We've experimented all kinds of litter, including the most popular clumping clay. However, we notice that bentonite granules often get stuck within cats' paws. These granules can be swallowed by cats when they are licking the paws. It's very dangerous as clay is non-digestible. As for crystals, they usually have ragged surfaces, which is not ideal for cats because with a large concentration of nerve receptors, their paws are sensitive. Therefore, we use the biodegradable corn litter mostly now. And it works perfectly well with Footloose.            Litter tracking and spillage are minimized with Footloose. Holes on the doorstep helps stretch cats' paws to get rid of the granules. Also, as cats jump out of the box from above, litter is tracked within a small area outside the single opening, better than all the place in your house.            We used almost all self-cleaning litter boxes available on the market. We were confused by those ""more advanced"" models. The buttons, lights, colors, blinks, etc. were overwhelming. Let alone the glitches that require troubleshooting frequently.  Features, from our perspective, shall not override usability. Footloose is equipped with a crispy LED display and only one button. The display shows machine status that is worth noticing, including Countdown, Cleaning, Emptying, Pairing, Error and Full. The button is mostly used for manually triggering or pausing a cleaning cycle.       Interactions Made Easy  We're committed to deliver you the best possible user experience. The functional details are not only ergonomic, but also proven highly useful in different scenarios.                 Designed to safeguard your furry friends as well as your wallet, Footloose is a one-time investment that saves you both time and money. Paying for custom-made liners, cat litter, waste receptacles, cartridges or other replacements should be an option, not a voluntary-but-mandatory cost to claim the benefits of automation.  Note: Assume 2 cats. Detailed calculations are available in this  shared spreadsheet  .                                                At Petato, it's our innovative minds that set us apart. We're a passionate team of designers, engineers and social entrepreneurs who are true ailurophiles. We bring objects to life through creative designs, robotics and artificial intelligence, allowing people to live smarter with their furry friends and turning people's home into a utopia for pets.  Our Founder Byron always knew he wanted to create disruptive tech to make things easier for pets and pet parents. The idea for Petato began after hearing friends were giving away their pets because of pregnancy or their busy schedules. This led to taking on the challenge of creating an automatic cat toilet that would enable cat owners to take better care of the fur-kids. Prior to founding Petato, Byron spent 3 years and contributed to its skyrocketing growth at DJI where his last role was the project manager for Matrice drones, FlightHub and other commercial application products. He was also the lead DJI rep of the SkyFund through which an ecosystem around drone platforms was developed from the ground up.  Why Kickstarter?  We've completed design for manufacturing &amp; assembly (DFMA) reviews. The next step is to create the tools that are necessary to manufacture different plastic parts of Footloose. Given the size of it, the biggest tool we're talking about will be as long as 4 ft in one direction. In contrast, a tool for your earbuds is just the size of a Coke can. Tooling cost of Footloose is about $300K. Though we're committed to deliver this product whatsoever, it'd be helpful to have a clear visibility of how many units we need to produce in the first batch.        ÃÂÃÂ Video by Launch Light Films         This project is promoted by    Jellop   , the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 500+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $235MM raised between them.                   Risks and challenges  WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re dedicated to delivering a flawless product, and you can rest assured that we'll do everything to fulfill your expectations. This is not our first Kickstarter campaign, and we've smoothed out many potential problems that may arise with production and fulfillment.  PRODUCT We spent tireless months enjoying the process of bringing Footloose to life. Now Footloose is almost complete. We've painstakingly chosen all the materials and production processes involved in the making of Footloose. However, there may be slight changes made to the finished product that will be shipped out to you. In any case, we promise to update you promptly and explain the nature and rationale behind any change.  PRODUCTION  We've already included holidays in the schedule. We work in very close collaboration with our manufacturer to ensure everything runs smoothly. Nevertheless, unexpected delays in production are still a possibility and may push back our estimated delivery date. We promise to keep you in the loop at all times and be fully transparent with you every step of the way.  TRADE AFFAIRS We'll be shipping you Footloose directly from our contract manufacturer in the Shenzhen area. For US backers, generally there will be no import duty for goods with a value lower than $800. However, we don't know where the ""trade war"" between US and China is heading or whether any tariff will be imposed. We had no issue shipping previous Kickstarter pledges but we'll keep a close eye on the latest policy."

It has a trigger and a sight, letting you easily open your bottle of fizz, and practice your bazooka skills!  It's made in the UK from solid stainless steel to my original design.  My critics will claim this product is a puerile attempt to combine my interests of alcohol and firearms, but the need originally arose when I visited my Grandparents in Northern Ireland to introduce them to my fiance. Delighted I'd finally convinced anyone to marry me, they got the champagne out. They asked me to open it, mentioning that their arthritis made it difficult for them to do so themselves.ÃÂÃÂ   Bottle openers for sparkling wine exist, but none of them let you shoot anything and instead of being fun, the overall experience feels like using a pair of scissors to open a packet of crisps, and is just as exciting.  I set out to make a more exciting product.   How it works       ÃÂÃÂ The Bottle Popper clips onto the cork of any champagne-style bottle where the wide part of the cork meets the bottle.ÃÂÃÂ Once attached, it becomes a simple lever. Pressing down on the back part of the bottle popper pulls the cork out of the bottle until the pressure in the bottle fires the cork with a satisfyingly loud pop.ÃÂÃÂ      The production model will be beautifully etched with a logo    What's the fun in any of this if you can't aim it? For optimum results, place the bottle on your shoulder and aim down the length of it through the sights. I went for iron sights, with different holes for range. Use the top one for targets at close range, aiming through the lower aperturesÃÂÃÂ  will allow you to engage targets at longer range.ÃÂÃÂ   Don't point/fire it at others or yourself, especially when you're attaching the Bottle Popper to the bottle.ÃÂÃÂ   I've tested this thing on as many fizzy, alcoholic drinks as I could, which was awesome. Brut Champagne provides the best range, though Prosecco, Cava, Asti and even pear cider work fine. Anything fizzy with a mushroom shaped cork seems to work. Chilling the bottle reduces the internal pressure (and range) and any recent rough handling increases it.     It also works as a regular bottle opener          Testimonials:    ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ ""I too struggled to open Champagne because of my arthritis. Thanks to the Bottle Popper I can open them with ease, and I can also engender fear in my enemies in ways I haven't been able to since The Falklands."" ÃÂÃÂ   Clive, Tunbridge Wells.   ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ ""Being alert to the threat of the Red Menace, I'd often wondered if my rusty anti-tank skills would be up to holding off the Red Army. Thanks to the Bottle Popper I have more practice now than I did before I was thrown out of the Girl Guides.""   Brenda, Torquay.  ÃÂÃÂ   ""My lack of confidence and panache opening champagne was the only thing holding back my rap career. Thanks to the Bottle Popper I won the respect of the local hip hop community and I'm headlining Kieran's Nan's house next Wednesday.""   Jimmy, Rathmullan       Do not point the bottle at other people or yourself. Sparkling wine bottles are famous for popping with little or no provocation. Make especially certain you don't point it at your face when you're attaching the Bottle Popper to the bottle.ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  This will be my second  Kickstarter campaign - my first being my offensive card game Common Decency. Successfully delivered back in 2016.  I've learnt a few lessons from the last one and I've made my supply chain as simple as possible.  Getting the products manufactured here in the UK, packing them myself and sending them out via Royal Mail will be a lot faster than using factories and fulfilment centres in China.   My estimated delivery date of the second week in December is conservative and also includes buffer time in case there are any hiccups along the way.  I've tested, adjusted and perfected my prototype and found my manufacturer. All I need now is your help in placing a full, commercial order!"

Your pledges will help getting around some of these costs.

We are sure that we can bring well-being and happiness not only to them, but also to their present or future partners.                 WHERE WE SHIP?  MYHIXEL will ship worldwide.  Our Early Bird Bakers will be awarded with ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>free shipping costsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ, so stay tuned to our Early Bird Rewards.  For our Myhixel Backers the shipping fee within the European Union is $6. Outside of the EU, the shipping fee is $19 worldwide and excludes GST, VAT,ÃÂÃÂ equivalent taxes and customs duties. GST and VAT, if any, will be collected from backers at the time of delivery. ÃÂÃÂ   WHEN WE START SHIPPING?  We plan to ship the product in February 2019. We will keep you up to date on our progress and the expected delivery date of your order. Actual ship dates may vary. We will keep you notified of your product ship date.  For questions about your order, please contactÃÂÃÂ  support@myhixel.com        If we get more than $ 20,000, we will use 10% of the rewards to continue researching sexual well-being methods for men and their partners. The idea is to make available methodologies that combine first quality products with exercise programs, that can be carried out in way that is playful, discreet and not annoying, as well as provide a follow-up that allows the users to see the progress of their training and the improvements they have made.  But we want to reward our Kickstarter bakers with exclusive gifts too ÃÂ°<U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>  So if we get 250% funded weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll add a Kickstarter Limited Edition Bag to carry your MYHIXEL I.  And if we get 500% funded, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll add a Lube bottle 4oz (118 ml) ÃÂÃÂ to your packÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦ so an awesome experience is guaranteed.                                We need your help to bring happiness to the world through our method. We have already proven that it works, now we need the last push to bring it to the market.ÃÂÃÂ   If you want to know more details about the Project, do not hesitate to visit us on  our website  ÃÂÃÂ and on our social networks:  Facebook ,  Instagram ,  Twitter ,  Twitter (Spain) ,  YouTube .ÃÂÃÂ                 #nextlevel #sexlevel      Risks and challenges  Myhixel is a scientifically proven method. We carried out a clinical trial with 56 men who ejaculated below 3 minutes, and the average of the patients tripled the duration of their sexual performance. But every man is different and many psychological and physiological factors affect ejaculatory control.  Our method has been proven to be effective in men with premature ejaculation, but we can not guarantee that it works with the same effectiveness in each case. What we do guarantee is that you have fun while you try to improve. It has no side effects and it doesnÃÂÃÂ´t involve investing in expensive therapies.  ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s made from top of range materials which have passed exhaustive reproductive toxicity tests and the CE certificate as sanitary product is in process. In any case, if you suffer from premature ejaculation or any other ejaculatory disorder, we recommend you to contact an expert in the field."

On top of the problems with durability, charging cables easily become a tangled mess, and keeping up with multiple lengths of cables for various purposes is nothing but a hassle.ÃÂÃÂ        With RevoWire, we aim to solve the three most common issues with phone charging cables:  durability, adjustability,  and  wire management . We made RevoWire to stand up to whatever you put it through, so it will be the last phone charger youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll ever buy.ÃÂÃÂ                              Charging cables often break near the connector from excessive strain. RevoWire has strain-relief technology built right in, so there is zero chance of your wire becoming a frayed mess. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve molded silicone into the connectorÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s housing, extending down the cable for maximum durability.ÃÂÃÂ   The strain reliever was designed to protect the weakest points in the cable. The silicone casing allows for the section to remain flexible without losing durability or sacrificing design.ÃÂÃÂ        The perforations along the RevoWire cable make storage and adjustability a breeze. Simply recoil your charging cable and insert the folding pin, located at the USB end of the cable, into one of the holes to ensure your cable wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t come undone. You can also adjust the length of your cable using the same process to help keep all of your wires neat and managed.ÃÂÃÂ        The flat cable design allows for simple wire management and prevents the cable from ÃÂÃÂ unraveling or becoming a tangled mess in your bag. You can easily roll the charging cable into a neat coil and toss it in your bag to take with you.ÃÂÃÂ        The reversible USB means you can plug RevoWire into a USB port quickly without having to check what side fits. Then just pop the charger into your phone- thereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s no guessing!ÃÂÃÂ        RevoWire achieves faster charging by using larger than average 21 AWG power wires.                                  Every product starts from a great idea, and RevoWire is no different. HereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s our story.  The idea for RevoWire hatched when our team, a group of college students from North Carolina, recognized the problems we had with standard phone charging cables. The wires often frayed and failed, became tangled in backpacks and purses, and were a nightmare to keep track of.ÃÂÃÂ   Our team set out to make charging more convenient and to design a product that would last. Determined to set a higher standard for charging cables, we put in months of hard work to bring you RevoWire. Built by a team that understands the importance of a reliable charge in every situation, RevoWire will make replacing phone charging cables a thing of the past. Thanks again for joining us on this journey!       We turned to Kickstarter because we saw ourselves on the leading edge of a way to help make our phone chargers as durable as possible. We believe RevoWire will stop people from purchasing so many new charging cables through the year-- yes, it will SAVE YOU MONEY!ÃÂÃÂ   The funds raised during this campaign will help us place initial orders with our manufacturer. Every dollar counts towards creating the last charging cable youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll ever need.ÃÂÃÂ                    We canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make RevoWire a reality.ÃÂÃÂ   We know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t give a dollar or purchase a RevoWire, if you like what we are doing, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!ÃÂÃÂ              Risks and challenges  There are always certain risks that can arise at any moment during a project like this. That being said, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re confident in our ability to produce, and have taken all of the necessary measures. We have a highly qualified team of engineers and have partnered with leading manufacturing and fulfilment companies around the world. We just need your help to bring everything to fruition. DonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t worry, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re completely prepared to bring RevoWire to you, and we have the manpower to make it happen, but if anything comes up along the way, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be the first to know."

This is true both for design with audacious and unconventional products and the way we envision our business to reach unique people.ÃÂÃÂ   In the Swiss watch industry, the vision hasn't changed over the last 100 years. Time for disruption has come. Be a leader, not a follower.ÃÂÃÂ Sharing this project with you on Kickstarter is the opportunity to create again our own path and rewrite some old established rules.ÃÂÃÂ   Why should unique products always be made available through the same channels to the same people? Kickstarter platform and community will allow us to finally develop, design and validate a watch collection directly from their future owners. You can make this happen as you have the possibility to bring this project to life with your support.ÃÂÃÂ      Schneider&amp;Co is a family business who every member brings his thoughts and opinions to push Schneider&amp;Co to its best level.     AN EXCLUSIVE LAUNCH ON KICKSTARTER  We have designed this new collection of two watches exclusively for the Kickstarter platform. If success hits this project, you would be proudly wearing a unique and limited production watch.ÃÂÃÂ   A successful campaign would definitely lead us to rethink the way we consider ourselves. This could push us to bring more creative and daring products to new and open-minded communities.  THE XTREME COLLECTION  Our new collection is composed of two models, Le Mans and Speedracer. Dedicated to car lovers and designed inspired by the legendary GT40.ÃÂÃÂ The two watches will come in four different executions based on Aluminum, used by all high-end Swiss watch brands, highly non-corrosive and anti-allergic.       The Speedracer and Le Mans are Swiss Made watches with unique and specific design and technical feature. Moreover, the aluminum movement and watch case are manufactured in-house. This gives the watches a unique look and all this below the weight of 50 grams, including strap.  The feeling provided by the product when you have it on your wrist is merely serious and luxurious. You won't be ashamed to compare it with much more expensive watches.   THE SPEEDRACER        ÃÂÃÂ           Speedracer details.  As you can see and perceive in the featured photos, the quality, finish and materials meet the highest expectations of the high-end luxury watch industry.

HIGH-QUALITY LEATHER STRAPS        Our high-quality leather straps come in tasteful orange or deep black with perforations that evoke vintage car racing.ÃÂÃÂ Laser engraved and tinted aluminum buckles.  CLASSIC AND PRESTIGE BOX   The luxurious prestige box comes with an aluminum engraved plate.ÃÂÃÂ On the example below, the Le Mans prestige box in full effect.            ÃÂÃÂ Here is the elegant classic box.       BENEFITS - MORE VALUE, LESS MONEY   Breaking the rules of tradition allows us to offer you a much better product final price. Which you will fully benefit. In this specific case from -50% to -75%! Compared to what retail price would have been. This represents a risk for us but we ready to take it and share the benefits.  In addition, early birds will get an Anchor aluminum Bracelet.  ÃÂÃÂ Aluminum anchor bracelet.       ÃÂÃÂ Aluminum anchor keychain.       Xtreme Stickers.            THE AMAZING PROPERTIES OF ALUMINUM.ÃÂÃÂ    Aluminum has a unique combination of attractive features. Many of them are extremely important for our efforts to create a more sustainable society. What properties are you looking for? ÃÂÃÂ Why use aluminum? More about our favorite material and discover new opportunities.ÃÂÃÂ     Recyclability.ÃÂÃÂ  Aluminum lasts forever and is theÃÂÃÂ environment'sÃÂÃÂ best friend.   SolidÃÂÃÂ and very light  because of its low density. However, extrusions can be made to be both strong and durable. It all depends on the application and the technique that is behind it. For a boat, naval architects can achieve weight savings of 40% compared to steel.ÃÂÃÂ    Weight. ÃÂÃÂ With a density of one-third of steel, 2,700 kg/m3, aluminum is very light. This is why it is continually replacing other materials in all branches of industry.   Resistance.ÃÂÃÂ  Light does not mean fragile. Aluminum alloys have tensile strengths of between 70 and 700 MPa. Unlike most steels, its resistance increases at low temperatures. This makes aluminum a natural choice in many circumstances.ÃÂÃÂ    Machining.ÃÂÃÂ  The machining of this material is incredible versatility. Milling, drilling, cutting, punching, and bending are common machining methods for aluminum. In addition, the energy input during machining is low, resulting in a greener environmental footprint.    Incombustible.ÃÂÃÂ  It has better fire protection characteristics than carbon fiber, which contains flammable resins.ÃÂÃÂ    Assembly.ÃÂÃÂ  Features facilitating assembly are often incorporated from the design stage of the profile. Fusion welding, friction welding, thermocompression, and bonding are other methods used for assembly.   ShieldÃÂÃÂ Against electromagnetic radiation.  Due to their tightness, aluminum housings can effectively exclude or filter electromagnetic radiation (EMC). The higher the conductivity of a material, the better its filtering qualities.   Corrosion resistance.ÃÂÃÂ  Have you ever seen rusty aluminum? Aluminum reacts with oxygen in the air to form an extremely thin layer of oxide. Despite its thickness of only a few hundredths of a micron (1 micron is one-thousandth of a millimeter), this layer is very dense and provides excellent protection against corrosion. If it is damaged, this layer is able to self-restore.   Aluminum Vs Steel. ÃÂÃÂ Aluminum's ability to absorb energy is greater than steel, which is why the material is used for safety purposes such as fire and blast resistance, bullet-proofing and burglary-resistant systems.  In comparison to aluminum, copper is heavy and more expensive. In particular, for fully electric vehicles the switch to the cheaper and lighter aluminum provides an opportunity to save cost and weight.ÃÂÃÂ   Aluminum alloys used in shipbuilding corrode around 100 times slower than steel.  PRODUCTION   We have a humble objective of 50 watches to consider this project a first success and start the production. Under this amount of units, it would cost us too much time and resources to build up a serious production capacity.ÃÂÃÂ   Hopefully, this project will be successful with your support. Should this be the case, we would start production of the first watches few days after the end of the campaign. Once you have chosen and confirmed your model selection.ÃÂÃÂ   WARRANTY &amp; FAQSÃÂÃÂ   Maintaining the high quality we are already known for is one of our prerogatives, and so we want to ensure your Watch lasts as long as it should. Each watch body (straps excluded) comes with a two-year warranty on workmanship, materials and parts, and beyond that, we are always wanting to be in touch to be sure you are satisfied with your watch.  SHARING  We love telling our story, and if you love it too, feel free to share using the pictures, background information and more you will find here. Whether youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re a journalist or a fan, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re just glad to have you here with us as we take off on our journey. Feel free to reach out any time.       DELIVERIES  Normal production capacity increase will allow us to deliver the watches around December 2018.ÃÂÃÂ Components production and watch assembly can take from 2 to 4 months.ÃÂÃÂ   Free watch shipment worldwide is included in every package. However local customs taxes or VAT might be applied to the delivery. You will be personally informed on project status and your personal expected delivery time.ÃÂÃÂ        Risks and challenges  A successful campaign would undoubtedly lead us to rethink the way we consider ourselves. This could push us to bring more creative and daring products to new and open-minded communities.  As Schneider&amp;Co we are taking a risk ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094> small or big, who knows? ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094> But our values tell us to act so: - Try &amp; Succeed or Try &amp; Fail.  - Win or Learn but don't stay home.  Never has a Swiss watch brand created and developed a product especially for a community out of known and traditional distribution channels. Let's walk out of beaten tracks.  We are the first watch brand to do so! Out of the comfort zone. This is in our DNA! Exploring new ways to do things, creating new opportunities and above all getting directly in touch with our community and developing why not a new one. Let's make this happen with your support.  If we succeed with your help, we promise you it won't be the last project on Kickstarter. If we fail, we would at least have tried to break the rules one more time. We might even come back again sooner than expected! No established brand has ever thought and dared to do so. This is who we are. Disrupting conventional rules. Make incredible watches accessible. Above all, let's do not act like the others. They will certainly look at us with a condescending smile and certainly not understand our move.  Is that such a risk in the end? Regarding Speedracer and Le Mans project, we master all technical and production aspects. All products images you have seen in the provides images are already second generation samples. Therefore the major issue we might face if this campaign is successful would be a technical problem during production this spring which could delay deliveries by one or two months. Should such an unexpected problem happen, you would be the first ones to be personally informed by you Schneider&amp;Co Kickstarter team.  Do not hesitate to contact us directly  schneiderandcowatch@gmail.com . Alain is in charge. We will be more than happy to provide you with detailed and further information regarding the project and your watch status. Let's make this happen with your support and get the very best value for your money. Your dedicated Schneider&amp;Co's Kickstarter team.  Alain Schneider"

RISK &amp; CHALLENGES  Product industrialization is ready.  The major risk is about the supply but we already set up some actions:  -       Electronic: 50 pieces are already built. A minimum of 5000 copies are required to be able to build our electronic cards by several suppliers.  -       Wooden base : 300 pieces are already built.  1 ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> We self-create the capsules by LASER.  2 ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> We have the ability to build 1000 pieces by our teams formed on industrial laser and milling machines. We hired several French suppliers ready to work with us if as soon as quantities are reached.  PACKAGING:  1 ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> The box is secured by a supplier and a French agency. We already qualified 300 pieces.  2 ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> Rigging: In 15 days we will receive 300 copies which will be qualified before packaging.  APPLICATION:  The app is already featured with 4 features ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>associate Bacchus one and read his indicatorsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ, ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Search a professionalÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ, ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Consult the events and articles about the followed professionalsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ, ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Consult articles and good plans from MyBacchusÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ. Other features will be added later. We also secured the app ergonomics with user tests which started this September and will take place until the end of October.  The Bacchus One intelligence algorithm will evolve in the next 9 months. Bacchus One is actually in machine learning within several packaging. Today Bacchus One take 10 minutes to analyse your context, we will reduce this learning time with the ambition to cut it by half until this December"

ÃÂÃÂ   BioControle is a powerfull interface connected to a Raspberry-Pi 3, and offers a lot of features to control your aquaponics systems, hydroponics systems, or any other system that need several kinds of IOs.            full protected user IOs and power supply input      full protection between your application and your Raspberry      4 power relays outputs      2 inputs/outputs for temperature and humidity sensors      2 logical inputs and 2 logical outputs      Real Time Clock      EEPROM      12 bits ADC      12 bits DAC      2 power servomotor outputs      enhanced PCB design for CSI and DSI headers       ÃÂÃÂ All inputs and outputs are protected from and to external devices and protect your Raspberry Pi !                     Who are Upsilon Engineering and Yann Leidwanger ?    This project,  BioControle , is supported by  Upsilon Engineering , based in  Luxembourg .   https://www.upsilon-engineering.lu/    ÃÂÃÂ I'm Yann Leidwanger , the founder and manager of Upsilon Engineering. I'm 42 years old, with more 20 years background in electronics hardware design and especially PCBs routing.  ÃÂÃÂ I designed more than 400 boards, for  industry ,  medical ,  automotive ,  defense ,  earth RF stations  and  satellites .     Why a brand-new aquaponic / hydroponic board ?    ÃÂÃÂ The project was initially developed for the  ThiLab , a FabLab based in Thionville, France, where I discover aquaponics systems, and I thought it was so cool !   ÃÂÃÂ https://fr-fr.facebook.com/FabLabThionville/   ÃÂÃÂ The proof of concept prototype drives one servomotor (fishes food dispenser), one warm power lamp and one temperature sensor (water).  ÃÂÃÂ Afterwards,  I wanted to develop a professional board  with a lot of features, with extended features, wich protect the Raspberry Pi,  with a minimal cost, but not a minimal quality !     ÃÂÃÂ Moreover, the interface can be used for other purposes.            Roadmap of the design      ÃÂÃÂ First, I studied the needs of the users :   ONE temperature sensor, ONE humidity sensor, ONE power relay output, ONE servomotor output.    ÃÂÃÂ Secondly, I added more functionalities :   logical inputs and outputs, protected power supply input, power supply supervisors, ADC, DAC, RTC, EEPROM, programmable user led, protections for inputs and outputs...    ÃÂÃÂ Thirdly, I improved these initials specifications :   double all inputs and outputs, double temperature sensors inputs, double humidity sensors inputs, quadruple relays power outputs, use 12 bit ADC and DAC, protect all signals from and to external devices, double servomotor outputs, add a protection for power supply input, add analog filters on power supplies for ADC and DAC.          Components selection    ÃÂÃÂ I've chosen components according to all their electrical characteristics, performance, quality, but not price !   ÃÂÃÂ A ""minimal cost"" doesn't mean ""low cost"" (and low quality).      Schematics design    ÃÂÃÂ I drew schematics functions one by one,  constantly keeping in mind all the constraints :     functionalities      performance      quality      availability of IOs on Raspberry Pi      cost      ""next-step design"" (PCB layout, components placement, routing, PCB production, components assembly)              PCB design    ÃÂÃÂ  The layout and the routing of the board are very important  : it must ensure minimal surface, minimal height, allows acces to CSI and DSI headers, and allow mechanical fixing on Raspberry Pi.  ÃÂÃÂ The PCB is routed according to Class4 rules (0.21mm track width, 0.21mm clearance).  ÃÂÃÂ In order to optimize the costs, I've decided to place components only on TOP layer and standardize components references.          Production    ÃÂÃÂ For PCBs production and components assembly, I use a supplier with whom I have been working for a long time. Quality and quick delivery are always present with this firm.  ÃÂÃÂ  Boards are produced by batches of 100 PCBs , again to minimize costs.     Hardware and software tests     ÃÂÃÂ There is no bug on V1.0 revision, all hardware tests and software tests passed.   ÃÂÃÂ Even if this project is immediately functional, with no mistakes, I was not 100% satisfied :    the second power supply header is not useful      I used an uncommon pinout for servomotors               I need you !     ÃÂÃÂ I need your help to launch the BioControle V2.0 project on Kickstarter, and I'm sure you'll be thrilled after supporting or using it !

Americans spend 90% of their time indoors breathing stale air. ÃÂÃÂ We strive to make our homes energy efficient, but in doing so trap all of the toxins inside with no way for them to escape. ÃÂÃÂ Compounding this problem, studies have found that indoor pollutants can be more harmful to our bodies than outdoor pollutants, with some health effects not noticeable until years later.ÃÂÃÂ   That's where brÃÂ<U+0093>th comes in.ÃÂÃÂ                    How does brÃÂ<U+0093>th help?  The technology is pretty straight forward. brÃÂ<U+0093>th actively feeds the plants all of the toxins and carbon dioxide in the air around it. The plants then use this as fertilizer to grow stronger. These health-giving plants only need light from the lamp above, and water to create filtered, fresh, and clean air.        Turbo-charges real plants for 100% natural purification (non-natural air purifiers and ionizers can actually be  more harmful to your airflow  )    Purifies the air in a 10ÃÂ<U+0097>10 ft room more than 4x per day    Removes upwards of 70% of air toxins with a single pass through the unitÃÂÃÂ     Is engineered with a perfect and sleek design - all your friends will wish they had one ÃÂÃÂ     Tells you via app when to water or not, never needs fertilizing - perfect for those who don't have a green thumb!ÃÂÃÂ     Grow light automatically turns on/off every 12 hours or with a custom timer    Water reservoir lasts for 10 days and the sensor tells you exactly when to add more water        Simply download the brÃÂ<U+0093>th app to monitor how much air is being purified at any given time. brÃÂ<U+0093>th measures the plantÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s water level and alerts you when you need to add more. The unit's sensors make sure the water levels are always at an optimal level to keep you from over-watering or under-watering your plants. Zero plant care skills needed.ÃÂÃÂ                                                   WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re especially excited about this product because it also gives parents the chance to provide clean air to their young children. Babies breathe about 40 times per minute, which is 2x as much as an adult, and brÃÂ<U+0093>th is helping us give these little ones the purest air for their healthy development.  What's the science behind brÃÂ<U+0093>th?                            First, we developed the patented technology behind brÃÂ<U+0093>th in 2013 in the form of giant indoor green walls that force air toxins in a building through the plants to clean the air. In 2016, our green wall system successfully passed air purification tests run by Staffordshire University in England.       Then, in 2017, we had the idea to develop a table-top version of our green wall. ÃÂÃÂ The idea of the smaller unit is to bring the same air purification of a green wall to your personal space.  Thus, brÃÂ<U+0093>th was born.        In August, we contracted a 3rd party research team, Ambient Group Inc., to run official air purification tests on the brÃÂ<U+0093>th prototype. After running the initial test, the research team insisted that the results must be wrong - but brÃÂ<U+0093>th produced the same amazing results again and again. Even we were astounded at the breakthrough!ÃÂÃÂ        Here's a chart of the test results from the official study that shows brÃÂ<U+0093>th removes upwards of 70% of air toxins with just 1 pass through the unit!ÃÂÃÂ   You can view the full study release here.         This graph illustrates the culmination of testing experiments where formaldehyde was introduced directly into the air intake of the brÃÂ<U+0093>thÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ Unit. The gas, at the dosing point, was allowed to reach a steady state concentration (blue). Note that the proportional concentrations of formaldehyde within chamber (green) and the outlet from the chamber (red) do not increase appreciably during the dosing experiment. This equates to an approximate seventy percent formaldehyde removal rate from the airstream.ÃÂÃÂ         With brÃÂ<U+0093>thÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s technology, air is purified naturally using photosynthesis and bacteria cleaning processes in plants. The brÃÂ<U+0093>th unit uses a fan to capture indoor airflow and deliver it back to the plants, who convert toxins into organic compounds that they can use as food. The sugars plants produce in photosynthesis assist in this process by breaking down harmful bacteria into useful compounds. Using this active process versus the passive photosynthesis plants usually undergo, brÃÂ<U+0093>th has the bacteria-cleaning power of approximately 200 houseplants.  This is awesome! Now what?

More stretch goals and features to unlock will be announced soon.  Stay tuned!         Our Story   Ray Greenstreet,  co-founder of brÃÂ<U+0093>th, got started in the plant business in high school &amp; worked as a wholesale grower. By 2000, he was able to buy his own nursery in Lothian, MD. Today, Greenstreet Gardens has 3 thriving locations where Ray continues to supply 100% organic plants (many of which are grown on his own farm) to the entire DC metropolitan area.ÃÂÃÂ    Mark Prescott , co-founder of brÃÂ<U+0093>th, is an inventor and has been in the green industry for over 35 years. He's developed a number of products in the industrial air cleaning arena using phytoremediation to improve the air quality in buildings.  In 2013, Mark Prescott joined forces with Ray Greenstreet, and together they developed the patented technology behind brÃÂ<U+0093>th - first in the form of giant indoor green walls that force air toxins in a building through the plants to clean the air.  In 2017, they engineered the first table-top version of this active and 100% natural air purifier, and brÃÂ<U+0093>th was born!ÃÂÃÂ   Behind the Scenes ÃÂÃÂ   This demo is meant to showcase how this product works, where we are in the process, and what you can expect from brÃÂ<U+0093>th in the future.                                     Risks and challenges  No one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially the inventors. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Kickstarter as well as for full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment. But here are what we see as the risks and challenges:  MANUFACTURING: The great news is that weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re already ahead of the game. The mold for brÃÂ<U+0093>th is created. We are now producing and testing brÃÂ<U+0093>th units to ensure that they are ready for our backers. However, unforeseen revisions to the mold can happen. We want to ensure that our supporters are receiving a product that will last and that they will love. To minimize the possibility of unforeseen revisions, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve already begun manufacturing testing before our kickstarter launch. This gives us additional time in case of unforeseen delays. We are also working with experienced and professional manufacturing partners who have a track record for efficiency and quality.   We are also in the process of finalizing the brÃÂ<U+0093>th app. After kickstarter, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be making final touches on the app development as well as fine-tuning the appÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s performance to ensure the best customer experience and the best accuracy of the sensor data. Then the app needs to be approved by Android and Apple, which can take time. In order to minimize any delays concerning the app, we have involved experienced app development partners that know this process forwards and backwards.  PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As brÃÂ<U+0093>th gears up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. We have already made a pre-production prototype to test and refine brÃÂ<U+0093>th and allow us to incorporate our adjustments. This will always be beneficial for you, the consumer, and we will keep you up to speed if any changes are made and why.   FULFILLMENT: Even with greatest foresight and planning, unexpected circumstances can arise: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks, we have already begun the process and partnered with a reliable and efficient manufacturer, and just in case, we will have at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located. We also have product commercialization experts who will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.  Regarding plant shipping, especially international shipping, please take into consideration that there are shipping restrictions on soil and plants from the U.S. to certain countries. To handle this challenge effectively, we will be working with plant suppliers in those specific areas of the world that donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t allow U.S. plant and soil exports.   Also, based on country and availability, actual plant types may vary. We assure you that if plant substitutes are needed, we will personally reach out to each of our customers to notify them of the acceptable plant substitution(s). We will always choose the best plant substitutions that adhere to brÃÂ<U+0093>thÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s air purification standards, so that you still have the best product we can provide.  CONCLUSION: In the event that things don't go as planned, whether it's a delay in the manufacturing timeline, shipping date, or something else, we promise to communicate honestly with you and work around the clock until we correct the issue.

""Impossible!""  you say.ÃÂÃÂ   Well my friend, let me introduce you to the  future :ÃÂÃÂ         ASSEMBLES EASILY:         RUNS ON WATER:         PERFECT FOR FRUITS OR VEGETABLES:ÃÂÃÂ          WHAT IS IT:   Fenik has spent the last 4 years developing the Yuma 60L, an exciting new way to actively cool food ANYWHERE without the use of electricity! While most refrigerators need electrical components such as fans, air compressors and solar panels to work, the Yuma 60L has no wires or moving parts and can cool down food using only water!   Ever want something to use other than your loud, electricity guzzling refrigerator?    Ever feel the yearning to move off-grid or embrace #vanlife? ÃÂÃÂ     Ever go camping but find that all the places that sell ice are closed? Or get lost on multi-day treks and realize a cooler full of melted ice isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t the answer?   The Yuma 60L could be what you're looking for.  HOW TO USE IT:ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        The Fenik Yuma 60L is incredibly simple to set up and use in seconds, and comes delivered flat-packed for easy mobility and transportation, meaning it can be put together in a pinch.ÃÂÃÂ   At 22.4 x 17.7 x 4.6 inches (or roughly the size of a standard pillow-case), you can grab the Yuma 60L and throw it into your bag for that camping trip, beach party or even keep stored in your home for earthquake preparedness.ÃÂÃÂ   Assemble the Yuma 60L by popping in the 4 fiberglass stays, fill it with food and water, and watch the magic work as the inside of the device begins to cool down!  HOW DOES IT WORK?ÃÂÃÂ        The real secret to the Yuma 60L is actually that it's not even that fancy or high-tech. If youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever wrapped a towel around a bottle of beer for the end of a hike, or run through a sprinkler or mister on a hot summerÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s day, you know how refreshing the feeling can be.ÃÂÃÂ   Our Yuma 60L works just like that, but comes in the form of a handy box.ÃÂÃÂ Like the above examples, it uses something called ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>evaporative cooling.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ The Yuma 60L stores water within the actual walls of the device. These walls are made of a special material called PhaseTekÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢, which allows water vapor to evaporate from the sides of the box without allowing any of the liquid water to leak out. Evaporating water pulls heat energy from the inside of the box decreasing the temperature an average of 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit from ambient conditions, and even more in dry, arid environments!ÃÂÃÂ   All of the cooling power of the Yuma 60L comes from the PhaseTekÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ material, so you'll never have to worry about finding an outlet - being self-reliant in nature never felt so easy.  SPECIFICATIONS:       REWARDS:ÃÂÃÂ   Along with our Yuma 60L, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve got some exciting items and rewards as a big thank you for supporting us.           Get Cash Back on the Projects You Love!     OUR STORYÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        Fenik, originally known as Evaptainers, started out as a student project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The purpose of the project was to develop a low-cost method of preserving fruits and vegetables in remote areas. The research culminated in the invention of the Yuma 60L, which achieves refrigeration through the use of smart materials and the phenomenon of evaporative cooling.ÃÂÃÂ   4 years of R&amp;D have brought us through countless prototypes, product iterations, thermal tests, CAD designs and factory visits. Our engineering team has truly invented something novel and innovative, and after rigorous field and lab testing, we are confident our device is ready for mainstream audiences.  OUR SOCIAL MISSIONÃÂÃÂ        If you thought we spent the last 4 years developing a low-cost refrigerator for glampers, you're sorely mistaken! Over 1.2 billion people still lack access to electricity, and without electricity, any type of refrigeration. Our core mission is to help these families out of a tough spot by providing products that can improve their lives.ÃÂÃÂ   We've already been working in throughout Morocco for the last 3 years, and are collaborating with USAID to conduct a large scale development project next summer.ÃÂÃÂ   In the future, we plan to continue designing products for use emerging markets and remote areas, and your support will definitely help us on our mission.  ÃÂÃÂ To learn more about our work in North Africa watch our 2016 explainer videoÃÂÃÂ                             FAQs   HOW COLD DOES THIS ACTUALLY GET? ÃÂÃÂ   As an evaporative cooler, the Yuma 60L is dependent on ambient temperature and humidity. Our device will never get as cold as a standard compression refrigerator, so if you are looking for something that can serve you a chilly ice-cold brew, unfortunately this product is not for you. However, our device can take your beverage from ""lukewarm and gross"" to ""nice and refreshing"" (and your beer will thank you for it).  ÃÂÃÂ  Expected Temperature Decrease   ÃÂÃÂ (In Fahrenheit)       ÃÂÃÂ (In Celsius)       ÃÂÃÂ  Expected Temperature Inside   ÃÂÃÂ (In Fahrenheit)ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ (In Celsius)        CAN I STORE MEAT IN THIS? ÃÂÃÂ   No. The Yuma 60L is designed for use with fruits, vegetables, beverages, dairy products, and snacks that might melt (chocolates, etc).ÃÂÃÂ    HOW LONG WILL THIS COOL FOR?   The Yuma 60L will stay cool as long as the walls are filled with water. Each device has a holding capacity of about 4 liters of water and uses 0.5 liters of water per day. We recommend topping off the Yuma 60L with water every morning.   HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM ZEER POTS OR COOLGARDIE SAFES?   Please see the answer to this in the FAQ.   CAN I USE THIS INSIDE?   Absolutely! Most of our users in Morocco actually use this inside their homes. Just store it in a cool or dry part of the house and the device will continue to work normally. Consult the charts above for an estimate of how cold it will be inside the device.   HOW EASY IS IT TO SET UP?   The Yuma 60L can go from flat to ready-to-use in under 20 seconds! Simply open the door, remove the fiberglass rods, and lift the top up to its full height, then click the 4 rods into the corners. It's really that simple!     Easy Assembly!      HOW DO I FILL IT?   Filling is designed to be easy! Once the unit is setup, pull the fill flap Velcro away from the door and separate the two sides, then pour water in between them. With a new Yuma 60L you may need to tilt it as you are filling to make sure the water fills all of the sides during the first use. ÃÂÃÂ      Runs on Water!     WHERE DOES THE FOOD GO?   To use the Yuma 60L once it is deployed and walls are full of water, simply open the door and put your food inside. The Fill flap doubles as a handy hinge.     Super Simple To Use!     HOW DO I COLLAPSE THE YUMA 60L?   To return the Yuma 60L to its flat state for transport, open the fill flap and turn it over to remove the residual water. Don't try to collapse it while there is water inside as this may damage the PhaseTekÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ walls. Once the water is gone, you can pull the fiberglass rods out of the corners and flatten it. We recommend giving it some time while it is empty to dry our before packing it up to go.ÃÂÃÂ    WHAT SHOULD I PUT IN MY YUMA 60L?   Your new Fenik cooler is ideal for fruits and vegetables as well as other things that should be kept at a stable room temperature. It's great for chocolate - no one likes a melted chocolate bar - as well as cheese. Some food, like bananas last longer in a Yuma than a traditional ice cooler because they are susceptible to frost.ÃÂÃÂ      (left) Bananas kept on ice (right) Bananas kept in a Yuma 60L     HOW LONG WILL FOOD LAST IN MY YUMA 60L?   Depending on environmental conditions (heat and humidity) food inside of a Yuma 60L can last 3-5x longer than food left outside.ÃÂÃÂ    WHAT STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT IS THE FENIK YUMA 60L COOLER IN?   We are already in production! As part of our field trials with USAID and Siemens Stiftung, the industrial tooling has already has already been built and the first 500 units are currently in production. Unlike with many other crowdfunding campaigns, it was important to us that we work out many of the production issues BEFORE offing the Yuma 60L for sale to you. We still very much need your help to fulfill our mission in the developing world - without your participation we won't have the resources necessary to support our work in emerging markets.ÃÂÃÂ      Industrial Vacuform Machine        Get Your Project Funded Today!         Risks and challenges  The Fenik team has spent the last 2 years building the supply chain and creating the manufacturing/tooling needed to produce the Yuma cooler. We waited longer than is typical in a product's life cycle to pursue crowdfunding because we wanted to work through many of the problems that normally plague campaigns in advance and give you the best customer experience possible. With that said, crowdfunding isn't e-commerce and there are inherent risks which we we want to be upfront about.   1) Fenik is a labor of love. The co-founders have spent years working on the project without compensation because we believe refrigeration is a fundamental right and want to make it more accessible to everyone. Our business model is unusual in that we are trying to sell products to low-income families living off-grid for as close to cost as we can. This is made possible because of initiatives like this Kickstarter campaign, which help us cover the company's ongoing overhead. We believe that this arrangement is incredibly powerful and will allow us to impact the lives of exponentially more people than a traditional donation model. What this means is: while we have plenty determination and heart, we don't have endless financial resources. We are proud of what we have accomplished so far, but if manufacturing problems arise, things MAY take a little extra time than anticipated. Have faith that we will do everything in our power to resolve any obstacle which presents itself as quickly as we can.     2) Another potential risk is our choice in offering the Yuma Cooler to anyone in the world. This is a risk simply because shipping logistics can get really complicated (and very expensive), especially with a larger item like the Fenik Yuma 60L. Because of the incredible responses we've gotten on our website from people all around the world, we wanted to give everyone a chance to purchase one of these units and we are doing everything we can to be very upfront about what it takes to get you your Yuma Cooler. All international fees include the total cost of freight (meaning you will NOT receive any extra charges upon arrival). We can assure you that we are not making any money on our international shipping fees, only covering a portion of the full charges. If you are interested in purchasing a Yuma 60L and don't live in one of the countries that we have quoted shipping for, please reach out so that we can calculate what it will cost to get one to you.  We know how important communication is and we pledge to be open and transparent with you to the best of our abilities.

Crown Rollers are designed to be your first and last set of rollers.    We have combined physics, engineering, and design to create a cycling roller that is naturally stable and maintains your true bike fit.  ÃÂÃÂ   Update:2018-09-18  Shane Miller tried our rollers at Interbike 2018 and pretty much sums up the amazement people are having when riding Crown Rollers, Here is an unbiased opinion of what he calls ""Magic Rollers"". Thanks Shane!       How it works:ÃÂÃÂ   Stability                 Crown Rollers are stable because your tire will seek the path of least resistance.  The larger diameter section at the center of the roller is the easiest to ride, so that is where your wheel wants to go.   Technical Note: When buying rollers, larger rollers have less rolling resistance (easier.)ÃÂÃÂ  Smaller rollers have more rolling resistance (harder.) This is due to the deformation of the tire on the roller. See why Crown Roller is so clever?ÃÂÃÂ   Why isn't the rear roller crowned?ÃÂÃÂ  Testing.ÃÂÃÂ  We experimented with every conceivable roller shape and positional combination to optimize stability for both new and experienced riders.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    How it works:   Level-Fit Frame            On rollers, the front wheel sits on TOP of the front roller, while the rear wheel sits BETWEEN the rear rollers.  This causes the rear wheel to sag relative to the front, impacting your bike fit.ÃÂÃÂ   Crown RollerÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s Level-Fit Frame raises the rear rollers so that you ride flat, just like on the road. ÃÂÃÂ   Technical Note: Crown Rollers come shipped with rear rollers in the Level-Fit position.ÃÂÃÂ  These rear rollers can also be lowered to the traditional position based on rider preference.ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ As Featured On:      GP Lama         Bike Rumor        Gear Mashers       CyclingTips        Global Cycling Network: GCN Tech   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ      KOLO 8 News Now: Reno        BikeRoar     Why rollers?   Cyclists don't just pedal along on rollers. They engage with the rollers, steering and balancing to control the bicycle.ÃÂÃÂ  By requiring the rider to control the bike and constantly engage and balance, rollers create the most realistic indoor riding experience possible.ÃÂÃÂ   Since you dynamically interact with rollers, you recruit more stabilizing and core muscles than you would on a stationary trainer or spin bike.  In addition, prolonged workouts in a fixed position will train certain muscle groups while ignoring other groups that are critical to effectively riding on the road.  This improved muscular engagement and the conscious interaction that you as a rider have with rollers result in improved fitness for the coming season as well as improved bike handling skills.ÃÂÃÂ   Rollers are also the most effective way to identify and correct inefficiencies in your pedal stroke.  Feedback from the rollers will result in a type of vertical bounceÃÂÃÂ  if a rider's pedal stroke is rough.ÃÂÃÂ  Riders intuitively smooth those sections of the pedal stroke when they consistently train on rollers.  ÃÂÃÂ   Rollers have always had these advantages, but the lack of stability kept them out of reach of the average rider.  Crown Rollers make these advantages available to almost any rider.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    Background ÃÂÃÂ   When we first started riding trainers, we had a hard time. As engineers, we wanted to make our riding experience better. Logically, the first roller shape we went to was a deep V shape. How wrong we were. When using this troughed roller, it was almost impossible for the rider to stay centered. Additionally, the rider was easily thrown off of the trainer. Thinking creatively, we tested the inverse of the troughed shape; a crowned roller. The result was the smooth ride of the most stable cycling roller in the world, Crown Rollers.  Crown Rollers have amazed everyone who has tested them with their stability, smoothness, and bike fit. From Ph.D. engineers to seasoned professional riders, they start with skepticism and end with astonishment.      Risks and challenges  We are ready to bring Crown Rollers to market. Our first 5 units have already arrived and were at interbike 2018 for demo and display. Current production units are in process. Your pledge will provide the capital to pay our manufactures and ship the product.  Delivery is estimated for the end of November. The Biggest risk of this campaign is that the boat could sink. But insurance would handle that.  We are excited to make Crown Rollers available for everyone. We know you will love them as much as we do."

Now is your chance to race Monte Carlo, try your odds in an asteroid field or fly a Spitfire literally by the seat of your pants. We have an incredible 90+ degrees of roll so youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll feel every hairpin turn like youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re there and enough pitch pushing you back to make you think youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re on a Falcon 9.                     Virtual reality means that players are now able to experience racing and flying games with an amazing amount of realism, but while their eyes are telling them theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re zooming through a rocky valley, their body doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t move. By adding full body physical feedback, players can feel the thrill of moving at high speed with none of the danger. Motion simulators are traditionally beyond the budget of most gamers since they use hugely expensive linear actuators that only have a limited range of travel, but the Feel Threes motors quickly rotate the user instead. By pitching the sim backwards and forwards in concert to the game you feel acceleration and deceleration as the weight of your body is pushed backwards into the seat and released, while turns are felt with large rolls to the side.  ÃÂÃÂ        Most other sims have a small range of motion, so they try to intensify the experience by translating every tiny movement you might feel. They canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t generate g-forces for acceleration and turning, but instead simulate every minor bump in the road. This might be fun for a while, but theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re really just shaking your head around. Instead we put the bumps through our tactile transducers and leave the g-forces to our incredible 100 degrees of pitch and roll. You get all the fun of the track and none of the neck ache.                                                                                                            The simulator is a half sphere which sits in a base containing wheels and motors to move the user in three degrees of rotation: pitch, roll and yaw. Because the center of gravity is at the center of the sphere there is no lifting, and the simulator is very easy to move.       ÃÂÃÂ The wheels in the base are  omniwheels , which have multiple rollers, so they can add force in one direction while not interfering with the other motors.        Tactile transducers  add vibration from the game in several places to increase immersion. These small, powerful devices let you feel your engine revs, gunfire and other impacts and are placed by your feet, hands and back.ÃÂÃÂ   A  tracker  near the players head constantly updates the orientation of the sphere and cancels the movement of the simulator from the players view. The simulator can accommodate users from children to tall adults, we support every type of controller and they can be quickly changed.       Each armrest has an easily removable plate of 220 x 280mm which users can attach their controllers to and these can quickly be swapped between play sessions. This is large enough to fit virtually every common controller type available. The most popular controllers chosen by backers will have holes pre-drilled and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll supply a chart for most other controllers so you can add your own holes. Steering wheels and flight yokes can be attached to a lightweight optional shelf which is attached to both armrests and can be rotated forward to let the user enter the cockpit. We will predrill holes for one of the 10 most preferred controller type or supply information on hole placement for many other wheels/yokes. ÃÂÃÂ   Full dimensions/drawings for these plates will be supplied to customers if they prefer to make their own or order them from local suppliers under a non commercial license. So you can make and order them, but not sell them yourself. We will also sell them if you want some spare.       ÃÂÃÂ We use our own proprietary software suite to control the simulator and calculate the optimal rotation of the 3+ motors to move the simulator and user. Users can control the speed and intensity of each game, as well as set limits on how much rotation they want to experience. Non VR titles are also supported by the use of a virtual 2D screen in front of the user, which is a great way to play much older games. We also use another program to pipe surround sound audio to the vibrating tactile transducers around the player, so they feel the game even when stationary. Finally we use an onboard tracker to measure the position of the simulator but also remove any simulator motion from the users view.  ÃÂÃÂ   Every single game ever made is supported via Virtual Screen mode and controller mode input, even emulated and classic games. Use the software to define when your controllers do and enjoy thousands of non-VR games in a virtual environment. Set your joystick or wheel to rotate the sphere depending on your inputs and share your settings. This isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t perfect since the simulator should ideally be taking cues from the in game vehicle physics, but it's the easiest way to play classics like X-wing vs Tie fighter or Ace Combat via emulator.       ÃÂÃÂ We need to track the platform and uses these readings to cancel the movement in your headset. Many motion simulators have a small range of pitch and roll so the user can simply keep looking forward despite the movement and chance of discomfort. This then means their view will float around in the car as they drive, which is fine for some people, not ok for others.  ÃÂÃÂ   Since we have such as massive range of possible motion, including the ability to completely rotate in the yaw axis, motion cancellation is a hard requirement.  ÃÂÃÂ   There are currently six ways to achieve this:     Individual game support . Developers add code to read a VR tracker or controller and use this to cancel the motion. ÃÂÃÂ    Native Engine support.  Unity or Unreal add this as a feature and developers simply enable the option and recompile. ÃÂÃÂ    An API wrapper . We use a small program that reads the rotation/position from a controller and the headset and cancels the motion for any game through the headset API. This can break on updates to the software that controls the headset. ÃÂÃÂ    Native support through the OpenXR initiative.  This is a consortium of the major players in the VR industry with the aim of unifying VR hardware and software to a standard. ÃÂÃÂ    Native support from the headset manufacturer.  The vendor adds, and updates their software to allow motion cancellation as an option so that it works for any title (or only certain titles).   This is the section where we might lose some backers, but weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re ok with that since we prefer to be transparent and honest. Other campaigns might avoid the pointing out the problem or say that there are no issues, but we think if you trust us with your hard earned money you deserve the truth. There is currently no acceptable motion cancellation for the Oculus rift. On OpenVR headsets such as the HTC Vive we have 100% functionality, but the rift currently doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t have a solution. ÃÂÃÂ   This is not to say there will never be a solution, and you can bet weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be working on the issue as one of our top priorities if weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re funded since rift users make up a huge portion of our possible customers. If you're a coder who can solve this, we'd love to pay you to do so. We will be returning for the fourth time to Oculus Connect this year to again speak to Oculus about adding native support, so your pledges could make all the difference. Tell Oculus you want this as a feature and hopefully now they will listen, VR is amazing for simulation games, why wouldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t they want to add support for all motion simulators? ÃÂÃÂ   If they donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t then we have the other four options above to use in pursuit of a solution, and the other sixth and final option for our backers. Switch to a SteamVR headset. We love the rift but if you canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t use it with a motion simulator then other HMDs are not too different in price or features.

If the simulator is out of your price range or a little too large to buy right now why not start your racing or flying career with our battle station? It's exactly the same cockpit that goes into the Feel Three, so when you're ready to upgrade you can just build the sim and move everything over, with all your mods and tweaks untouched.ÃÂÃÂ   There is no need to feel like you're missing out on the action either as it has the same built in tactile transducers so you can feel every corner, as well as the same ability to fine tune your controllers position so you're always comfortable.                           Build your own holonomic robot with our incredibly affordable heavy duty omniwheel kits. Each is a single hub of 5 rollers, is 127mm in diameter, and has a load capacity of 100kg. Double up the hubs for a regular omniwheel and smooth operation, or add more for better weight distribution.             Want to go full 360ÃÂÃÂ°? Sometimes even 100ÃÂÃÂ° pitch and roll just isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t enough, so expand your possibilities with extra panels. Includes connection plates. Must be purchased with full simulator, but this is a semi-unsupported extra since you'll need a different edge support if you want extra rotation.            The Feel Three was originally designed so home users would have an affordable choice for a high specification simulator but we also recognised that many would like to use these in arcades and other environments. We will be offering a specialised commercial unit at a later date, which will be more robust and cost more, but for now weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re charging a small fee for a limited number of licences use the simulator in a business environment.  We also highly recommend including the 3 motor upgrade in your package to accommodate heavier players as well as fitting a bucket seat for safety. Note you will also required to use a Simtools Entertainment Licence as well as purchase an arcade licence for any title you wish to charge someone to play.  ÃÂÃÂ   If you intend to charge someone to use your Feel Three simulator, by the hour, week or event, you need a commercial licence &amp; insurance. This is currently $2000. For more information, please see the FAQ or send a message.       If we donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t make it, we donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t want to sell it to you. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve already set ourselves up the pretty monumental task of manufacturing and distributing the simulators and battle stations, we would rather leave the other stuff to Amazon and Best Buy instead of marking up prices to pay for the inevitable support and overseas shipping. ÃÂÃÂ    Bucket Seats :  There are a thousand options and a thousand opinions about chairs. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>d rather you picked something right for you, after all, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be spend all your free time in a sim now, you better get it right. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll even give you some recommendations and advise what is the best fit.    Controllers :  Like seats the interface with your vehicle is personal and very important. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll support the most popular wheels and joysticks, and provide advice on attaching any controller to your sim, but weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll only sell spare adapter plates, not the peripherals. ÃÂÃÂ    LED strips :  The holes will be there for you to do as you will. LED strips are cheap and pretty easy to install, so weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll provide some tutorials but not the hardware. ÃÂÃÂ    Colour :  The Simulator and Battle Station come as bare metal. This makes it more affordable and gives you the option of then picking your own colour scheme instead of painting over something you didnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t want. Spraying and vinyl wraps are good options, we look forward to seeing the crazy designs. The lycra sphere cover comes in black.        Stretch goals are a great way for many crowdfunding campaigns to sustain interest through its life, but only if they are sensible and properly planned. Over ambitious goals might make a project seem more appealing but fulfilling these extra rewards can easily affect the core of the campaign and delay, or sometimes even kill, the project. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re now in the business of manufacturing a kick ass motion simulator, which weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve already heavily prototyped and is working really well. Adding extra shiny features because every campaign seems to do this is not how we want to move forward. Trust us, any suggest you might have has already probably been considered, and if it was too hard or expensive it didnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t make it in to the project. This is not to say the design wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t change moving forward, but we would rather add something as a nice addition you didnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t expect, rather than add something you didnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t really want, and make you wait another year.  Our business is building amazing sims! No T-shirts, no souvenirs, and no crazy stretch goals!        Instead of Stretch goals we have a list of Visions of how we would like to move the company forward. The sphere is pretty big and a reclined bucket seat configuration is just the beginning of whatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s possible. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll have options to switch out Battle Stations for a load of other cool options.     Choose your adventure!     Central Joystick mount  : We have the prototype. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s an easy addition to move your stick to between your knees. Chopper pilots, relax, it's coming.   Monitor Mount  : We LOVE VR here at FeelThree but we know not everyone else does, so weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve already prototyped a simple monitor mount that clips to the wheel shelf, to will be announced when itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s ready. This will be for small lightweight wide screen monitors, not 50ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ monsters since a major consideration is the change in the center of gravity, and the extra stress on the mount and monitor. ÃÂÃÂ    Fan . We can get the speed you're moving from the game so a powerful fan linked to your forward motion really adds another dimension. We prototyped it, it's awesome.ÃÂÃÂ    Virtual hotas  : We love real buttons, HAT switches and dials, but youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re in VR, which makes it a little tricky to hold a joystick and also push virtual buttons with a VR hand controller. So we want to make a simple mount you can magnetically attach to your controllers to make a nice in game joystick. Perfect for touch or Valve Knuckles while playing awesome games like VTOL VR! ÃÂÃÂ    Projector mount/screen  : If a monitor isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t big enough then how about a lightweight wrap around screen fed by a couple of pico projectors? ÃÂÃÂ    Heave  : Everyone wants to go up and down, and so do we. A heave add on will likely be our first major upgrade to the simulator. There is a lot of space beneath the battlestation to add it, but lots of work still to be done since it changes the center of gravity. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re pretty sure it can be done though, watch this space! ÃÂÃÂ    Speeder bikes  : Although we know there are plenty of people who love motorbikes (so do we!) we can do that in real life. Boring. What we canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t do is blast through the forests of Endor, shooting up stormtroopers and dodging Ewoks. With a couple of massive fans on the front and a counterweight below (so you canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t fall off) youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be saving the rebellion in style.ÃÂÃÂ    Cushions  : The simulator with no chair or cables, just the lycra cover, looks like a work of art, but is not too comfortable to climb into. So weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re planning on some beautiful triangular cushions that magnetically attach to the inside of the sim. Instead of racing cars you can be meditating or chasing dreams as you gently rock to sleep. ÃÂÃÂ    Paragliding  : Our founder is a paraglider, and although he loves it, admits itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s not the safest sport. With a simple frame and a couple of fans you could hang in a simulator instead and never worry about power lines again! ÃÂÃÂ    Full 360ÃÂÃÂ°  : This is a major challenge, but one weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re really interested in. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>d like to do it, not sure if we should, but something weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be investigating more as time goes on. ÃÂÃÂ    Smaller Spheres  : We have a great, and really simple design for a smaller version that we will continue with more funding.  Got a suggestion? We love to hear your ideas, maybe we'll add it to the list!       When we reach ÃÂÃÂ£500,000 in total company funding we will be joining the OpenXR group in order to represent motion simulation hardware in VR, and we hope this campaign will help us get there sooner. This is an important initiative from many of the top players in Virtual Reality to move towards a real standard so everything ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0098>just worksÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>, especially native motion cancellation.                        Shipping is complicated for most projects, but this goes double for a motion simulator. However, we think weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve come up with a fair way to cover shipping worldwide that keeps things extremely simple. ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ For most people shipping is included in the price, that is, we will cover the cost of the most economical shipping up to $200 ($50 for the Battle Station) from a main distribution point. So if you live in North America or Western Europe you need only wait patiently since we anticipate no extra charges. If you order from a country that doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t justify at least a half container your product will be shipped from the next best distributor (or direct from the Manufacturer) and you will be required to pay the extra shipping, which will be at cost. We wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t offer shipping upgrades but will of course provide tracking. ÃÂÃÂ   One of the reasons weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re able to offer our simulator at such an amazing price is partly due to the fact that it comes semi-built, so  some assembly is required . All required tools will be supplied as well as a manual and videos demonstrating the build procedure. If youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re not so handy we would recommend considering Task Rabbit or similar to do most of the building. It should only take an afternoon or so. ÃÂÃÂ   Backers will be required to pay all import taxes and duties before final delivery. Since weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re based in Europe weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re required to pay the VAT when we receive the funds, so backers who pay tax will need to reimburse this before we ship.         We would love to offer dev units to developers but sadly are unable to at this time. However weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re offering a great way for coders to get their hands on our amazing sim for free. Simply use our lightweight SDK for Unreal or Unity to output UDP motion data from your in game vehicles and cancel the motion of the simulator via an external tracker. Once you have reached a certain volume of sales for your title with native support weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll send you a free simulator. Commit during the campaign and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll start the clock now! See FAQ for more details.          Sharing is caring, and what better way to show you care than showing off your amazing new Simulator. Join our referral program, give some demos and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll give a discount to you new friends and credit towards future upgrades and current add-ons for you.

Going from prototype to the final device is going to take a lot more time and money. Being able to ship on the promised date relies on finding manufacturing partners who are reliable and timely but are also subject to problems with design and regulations. No hardware project on Kickstarter is really finished, there are always small tweaks to be made and improvements to be added.   We have a major advantage in that the Feel Three is based on an iterative design, so each of the 32 spherical panels are identical, the 160 connectors are identical, the base is made of 6 identical wedges, and the base/armrests are identical but mirrored. This means of the major manufactured components there are only a couple of dozen, and all but two can be quickly stamped and folded from flat sheet metal. We will use existing aluminium extrusion tubes instead of paying for a new design and the motors are off the shelf. The two major components that require somewhat complex manufacturing are the spherical panels and the omniwheel rollers. The panels however are a very simple design being only slightly curved but will require a large expensive stamping tool to shape them correctly. The rollers are a hard rubber overmolded onto plastic, but this is a common manufacturing method. Everything else is off the shelf, slightly processed extrusions or stamped from flat aluminium.  That is not to say manufacturing will be simple or easy, but we will not just be handing this off to a supplier and waiting on the delivery, we will have team members on site testing quality and building constant engineering samples for testing and quality.  The software is in Beta, but the core functionality is done, we can read the position of the simulator and move it in real time, it will be improved and features added with more funding. The electronics are very simple, since we're using standard DC motors and the power requirements are quite low. All the rotation processing is done on the PC so the control unit is a simple and easy to produce.  At all stages of the design the philosophy has been to design something that can quickly be taken to mass manufacturing, using as few components as possible. We don't need to worry about component miniaturization, wireless certification or power saving considerations.   Spheres are inherently strong and we will be performing rigorous checks to ensure the safety of our backers is not compromised.  The project is not risk free but the design is sound, the price sufficient that we can make a profit (and therefore afford to solve unexpected problems) and the demand for affordable simulators enough to build a successful business."

Scheduled*:  Set up an access for a defined period of time, or even on a recurring basis.   Three access types:     Passcode:  Passcodes need to be set up while you are near the lock and connected to it via Bluetooth. Once set up, you can share the passcodes however and whenever you want.     Fingerprint:  The fingerprint needs to be set up while you are near the lock and connected to it via Bluetooth.

The wifi bridge is not compatible with Keago for Indoor Latch.ÃÂÃÂ      You can still share the good old key whenever you need!         Our smart clutch is the core innovation of Keago! Standard smartlocks use a motor to move the bolt in and out, locking and unlocking your lock. We see many disadvantages to that:   Power: it takes a lot of force to move a spring-loaded bolt a few centimeters over. The power inside your lock ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> far from any outlet ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> is a very precious resource.   Unintuitive: people are used to locking and unlocking their doors manually. Once the door is unlocked you should be able to open it right away ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094> but motorized bolts require you to wait 1-2 seconds until the bolt is fully retracted to finally open the door. While you might get used to it after few days, your guests and family will likely mistreat your lock by trying to open it while the bolt is still retracting.   Failed locking: All smartlocks relock your door for you, but do they detect if the door is closed or not? If the door is left open while you go fetch the mail or say goodbye to a guest, other smartlocks will automatically relock after about 10 secondsÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>even if the door is still wide open. This may sound like a simple inconvenience, but it could pose real security threats. Other smartlocks do not register failed relocks on doors that appear to be closed but are not fully shut, the bolt might bump into your door frame without notice, leaving your house at risk of intrusion.        So how does Keago solve the problem?   Instead of motorizing the whole bolt, Keago has simply motorized a tiny clutch. Imagine a tiny pin aligned to a tiny notch. If the clutch is off, the pin is down and the door handle moves freely without moving the bolt. When the clutch is on, the pin goes inside the hole and conveys the motion from the handle to the lock.   This technology is nothing newÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s simply the way a key and keyhole traditionally work. The key pushes pins which engage and disengage  the lock. We have simply adapted that technology for digital use.    LetÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s see how that compares with the motorized bolts:     On power:  The clutch is tiny and requires very little force to move. The movement of the bolt, which requires greater force, is accomplished by the motion of the hand. This saves considerable power and increases battery life up to 2 years.   On intuition:  You can use your lock the way you always have. Unlock and relock when you need it. The main difference is that in addition to the key, you can also use your fingerprint or passcode and to unlock the door.   On failed locking:  Just like your traditional lock, Keago is relocked manually if and when desired. If the bolt is bumping into your door frame, you will feel it and resolve the problem as you have always done so far.     As you can see, when unlocked the bolt doesn't move, it's the hand motion that moves the bolts. Saving 90% of the power.              ÃÂÃÂ Keago is great right out of the box but certain functions require more power than batteries can offer. This is the case with the wifi bridge, with a range of 50 meters you can plug it almost anywhere in your house and it will unlock new features for your locks:ÃÂÃÂ   Note that the wifi bridge is sold separately and is not available for Keago - Indoor Latch version, as this version is more compact it doesn't have the space to fit the components that connect with the bridge.ÃÂÃÂ    Once and scheduled sharing:  sharing with those two methods require you to use a wifi bridge.   Opening remotely:  you may enable remote access and unlock your lock from anywhere in the world via internet.ÃÂÃÂ    Infinite log:  without a bridge Keago will record the last 50 access logs if log recording is enabled. With the wifi bridge and if enabled Keago will store this information online and therefore be able to record unlimited number of logs.       Locks come in all shapes and sizes, yet smartlocks always fit only one type of lock body. At Keago our team worked for over two years to develop the technology behind our lock. We feel that our software security, smart clutch innovation, and PCB development should not be restricted to any single lock type. This is why Keago comes in four models:         Keago Padlock:  For your suitcase, school locker, bike, door or anything that requires a padlock.   Keago Mortise:  For mortise lock body on your front door.    Keago Deadbolt:  For deadbolt lock body on your front door.    Keago Indoor Latch:  For latch bolt lock body on your interior doors.ÃÂÃÂ Now available in two options: Tall or Round. All with the same great features! (Despite the fact that we call it ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>indoor latchÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ - since it is mainly fit for North American indoor latch - this Keago just like all other version has the same weather and temperature resistance - it will suit perfectly an outdoor front door).  Each model is compatible with several installation types. More information on compatibility bellow.      Keago Indoor Latch Version is now available in two options: Tall on the left and Round on the right. All with the same great features!         Too many smartlocks are built like fashionable tech devices, not like locks. They use materials like aluminum that are soft, weak against skin acidity, heavy shocks, weather, and time. At Keago we have built our locks to be strong and durable.   As mentioned before, the casing is made of stainless steel and the glass is scratch resistant. The paint adds an extra layer of protection to the metal and has two coats in order to prevent chipping and scratches for many years.    The lock is also weather sealed. The prototypes have passed the IP4 test and will endure light rain - yet Keago might have trouble recognizing you fingerprint if your fingers or sensor are wet.   The electronics have been tested against heavy shocks and our software can be updated to avoid obsolescence.   Additionally, thanks to our power-saving smart clutch, you need not worry about the battery for 2 years.

The delivery time we promise on our campaign accounts for one month delivery delay. Meaning that if everything goes well, rewards will actually be shipped 1 month ahead of schedule.  We've learned how to avoid many obstacles, for example rewards shipped with batteries usually get stopped by either the carrier or the customs. This is why we won't include batteries in the box even if we'd like too.   Satisfaction is our priority as we want to turn our kickstarter project into a sustainable business. We hope to offer Keago for retail online in early Spring 2019. Therefore our backers' opinion and review matters, and a small percentage of every sale will be provisioned to cover problems that might occur such as re-shipping rewards lost by the carrier.    Another challenge will be to maintain our apps for the years to come. To remedy that problem we will provision a small percentage of every sale to cover the maintenance and update fees of our apps for the next 8 years."

Oh, what are ""Nixie-tubes""?   The word ""Nixie"" was formed from the words  N umeric  I ndicator e X erimental No.  1  and first introduced 1954 by Burroughs Corporation from USA as a brand name for numeric displays. Nixie tubes were used until the mid of the 1970's as displays in measuring devices, calculators, TV sets and the very first computers. The evolution of modern style display types like Numitron, VFD, Light Emitting Diodes and Liquid Crystal Displays, which have a very low supply voltage (battery power supply) eliminated these Nixie tubes from the market, and they are not produced anymore. In the former USSR Nixie tubes were produced as surplus in vast quantities until the beginning of the 90's ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> and from this sources is this tube. But even these supplies are now running short. And when they're gone, they're gone. The tube is taken from ""NOS"", what means  N ew  O ld  S tock. They were never used before and spent their first thirty or more years forgotten in some Russian warehouse. The principle of the Nixie tubes is based on a cold cathode discharge and it is used today a million times e.g. in small neon bulbs of illuminated mains power switches.  This Bargraph tube in the NixieTherm is a special construction of such a neon bulb, it can produce a current depending variable glow hight lenght when a current regulated voltage of around 140 VDC is applied.  Often were asked: ""What is the lifespan of a Nixie tube"" and than there is a simple answer: ""Have a look at your illuminated power switch of the multiple outlet strip.

Your Care, We Care   Imagine your parents or grandparents suffering from mobility difficulties, you may immediately come up with 2 things: (i) Wheelchair (ii) Carer. To facilitate this situation, we have thought of a fully caring solution to enhance the user experience from hardware to software meanwhile you, as a family member, will also feel comfy to buy for your beloved ones.  WheelCare includes:   A Power Wheelchair embedded with a smart tracking system  A smartwatch with health monitoring features   Not an ordinary Power Wheelchair     The specification of power wheelchair     Hardware specification:ÃÂÃÂ     The wheelchair is made from durable Lightweight Aircraft Quality Aluminium that allows it to hold up a weight of 300 lbs (~135 kg) yet it is 54 lbs only (~24.65 kg, without battery).  It is foldable with size 95X62X34 cm^3 only, that can easily fit into the compartment of most of the vehicles and much more convenient for travelling.  Supported by the lithium ion battery, the power wheelchair will be able to travel up to 15km by fully charged up in just 6 hours.  In the meantime, the handles help the carer pull and push easier and, the breathable seat cushion can be removable for easy cleaning.

Software specification:    Using Bluetooth technology, the embedded smart tracking system (i) will alert when the carer is out of the preset distance (between the carer and the elder) and, (ii) help the carer to locate the elder through our app. (Further explanation will be provided below)  With Electromagnetic Braking System, user can change from the power mode to the manual mode safely.The Power Wheelchair is going to apply for CE Mark and FDA certificate.   The Power Wheelchair is going to apply for CE Mark and FDA certificate.ÃÂÃÂ   What makes smart tracking system special to a Power Wheelchair?  For carers the most stressful thing shall be getting the elders lost accidentally. However, with tracking system, you won't have such worry by simply following a few steps:ÃÂÃÂ   (1) Download an app (2) Set the alert distance between the carer and the elder:( a) 1-2 m ; (b) 5-7 m; (c) 12-15 m (3) When you are out of the alert distance range, your mobile will ring loudly (4) Open the app and you will get the last location of the elder right after s/he is out of the alert distance  For example, one day Victoria goes to the supermarket with her mum with our power wheelchair and she spots that there is a super sale corner. She runs to the corner immediately as usual and when she is about to take a look of the one piece, she hears an alarm quite annoying...Gosh! She leaves mum behind! Thanks to the tracking system.

When the carer is away from the elder more than 15m, what should we do? If the tracking system is the 1st protection, then the smartwatch will be the 2nd protection to avoid missing the elder in a longer distance range:ÃÂÃÂ   (1) Ask the elder to wear the smartwatch before going out  (2) Same as the tracking system, you have to download an app for the smartwatch  (3) Simply click the GPS icon, the map will show the current location of the elder  (4) Find the elder successfully  Apart from the GPS, the smartwatch supports not only 4G and basic functions like voice and video call but also the heath tracking features such as  Heart Rate  and  Blood Pressure , which makes it the best smart buddy to the elderly.  With the smartwatch, your parents can make calls anytime anywhere instead of the clumsy mobile phone.

We hope the products of FTD can make contributions to the society that more and more people can be beneficial by a more affordable price but with better functionality.  WheelCare understands the needs of both the carers and the elders. We aim at providing a more considerate solution to show your care to the elders with our passionate engineering design. The double protection not only helps locate the elder physically but also relieves the stress of the carer mentally. The enhancement of the user experience for both parties in terms of better caring solution enables both sides can be well connected anytime, anywhere regardless of the distance.      Risks and challenges  Developing WheelCare involves lots of challenging electromechanical and software designs, such as lightweight with strong structural strength, combine size with foldable mechanism, battery life, ergonomic design and the wireless technologies embedded into the power wheelchair. We can foresee lots of testings from hardware to software to confirm the safety and the functionality, for example, the different road conditions and the apps' UI for the smartwatch."

In short, uStepper is a product improving performance of stepper motors, by combining an Arduino compatible MCU with a stepper driver and an encoder, into a very compact PCB !ÃÂÃÂ   uStepper was launched first in 2015 using Kickstarter - was successfully funded and rewards shipped out before estimated delivery date!You can visit the first campaign page  HERE .  Some of the benefits uStepper offers are listed below - they will all be explained in much deeper detail, later on !    Program uStepper with ease using the Arduino IDE and our extensive Arduino library !    Make your stepper motor applications extremely compact !    Make sure that you never miss a step again, thanks to the on-board encoder and control algorithm !    Improve your 3D Printer / CNC or similar machine, by adding uStepper to correct for missed steps !    Get started with robotics with the uStepper Robot arm or Delta Robot !       uStepper concept     Why Stepper motors ? ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Stepper motors are cheap, have high torque (at low speeds) and are precise! Because of this, they are used in a large variety of applications, including 3D printers.ÃÂÃÂ   There is one drawback of the steppers though ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> you actually canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t tell if they move to the position you tell them to.ÃÂÃÂ   What uStepper does, is that it removes this drawback by continuously monitoring the stepper rotor position, and comparing this to the commanded stepper rotor position. Thus, uStepper can compensate if anything goes wrong ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> this is what we call operating with feedback.           uStepper removes layer shifting in 3D prints    uStepper both has the ability to drive the stepper motor, monitor position and has an onboard programmable microcontroller with a wide range of available inputs and outputs. All this is packed into a really small printed circuit board that fits right on the back of those small stepper motors (which are referred to as NEMA 17).ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   To make uStepper accessible for both professionals, hobbyists and students, it is compatible with the Arduino IDE. Here you can easily program your uStepper to do exactly what you need it to do!ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    Customer statements    ""  I use uStepper in a test setup for regulating pressure in a water supply system. uStepper was a good match for the project since it incorporates both an Arduino compatible MCU, a motor control unit and position feedback. A well thought through product which has easy to use examples in Arduino making it easy to get started with!""    Simon Jensen, AssistantÃÂÃÂ Engineer, Department of Electronic Systems Aalborg University    ""I have been using the uStepper for a few small projects. The accuracy is very good, and it is very easy to get started. IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m looking forward to the new version!""    Kristian N.A. Bertelsen, Engineer at Cobham SATCOM   uStepper S line  uStepper was introduced in 2015, and technical advances has been made since then. With that in mind, we decided to develop a new line of uStepper boards consisting of three products. The new uStepper S product line is improved in all aspects, and especially the stepper driver have been given attention to make uStepper more Smooth and Silent!  From all the feedback we have gotten through the years, we have made a lot of software improvements, and with the S line we now also implement a lot of the hardware related feedback!  There will be at least two products in the S line and potentially three if stretch goals are reached:   uStepper S-lite - for NEMA 17 stepper motors  uStepper S - for NEMA 17/23 stepper motors  uStepper S10 - for NEMA 23/34/42 stepper motors (stretch goal)      uStepper comparison chart    ÃÂÃÂ  General setup ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   So the key idea was presented in the intro, and the first picture really explains a lot with very few words. Here we will give a little more in depth explaination!     uStepper S line key components    The key components are marked on the above picture, and is general for the uStepper and all the products in the new S line of uStepper.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    MCU   We use the successor of the well tested and widely used ATmega328P - the ATmega328PB. Why? Because it does the job and does it good! The new upgraded ATmega328PB has many of the things we believe makes the new uStepper a better product - double USART, double I2C, double SPI and upgraded timers!ÃÂÃÂ      New ATmega328PB MCU - Source: Microchip    Instead of beefing up to an advanced MCU that is not really needed, we decided to offload the MCU on uStepper S and S10 by introducing a more capable stepper driver chip!ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    Driver   The driver on uStepper handles the stepper motor power stage. On the uStepper S-lite the acceleration and velocity calculations are handled by the MCU just like on the original uStepper. Whereas on the uStepper S and S10 a driver with integrated acceleration and velocity handling is used - offloading the MCU.  One of the key issues of having a motor drive is the heat dissipation cause by switching the relatively large currents.ÃÂÃÂ      The main heat source is the stepper driver    To accomodate this we have used large internal copper planes for distributing the heat to the whole board, thereby using the board as heat sink. This functions well up to a current of ~1-1.5 A after which a heat sink and maybe even active cooling is needed depending on the load profile. An application with continuous ""high current"" load will of course make a large heat build-up compared to an application with sporadic ""high current"" load.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    Encoder   The encoder makes uStepper S line capable of closed loop position control - eliminating one of the key issues of the open loop stepper motor control. The encoder used on both uStepper S-lite and uStepper S/S10 senses a diametrically magnetised magnet placed on the motor shaft.     Source: AMS AS5600 Datasheet    uStepper S-lite provides you with a resolution of 0.088 degrees and uStepper S/S10 the obtainable resolution is 0.0055 degrees!ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   The boards in uStepper S-line provides absolute multi-revolution feedback at a rate of up to ~  200 kHzÃÂÃÂ   - which is used in the feedback algorithm for uStepper S-lite and uStepper S/S10 to move the stepper motor precisely to the position you command them to!   Voltage regulator   The stepper driver needs a higher supply voltage than 5 V in order to be able to drive the stepper motor at speeds that makes sense in most real applications. This of course requires a voltage regulatorÃÂÃÂ for supplying the MCU and pheripherals with 5 V or 3.3 V. Without this, the board would require two voltage sources to operate!  The voltage regulator also contributes to heat generation when lowering the supply voltage to the required 5 V and 3.3 V. The voltage regulator on uStepper S line benefits from the internal copper planes when having to dissipate some of this heat - just like the stepper driver.  On the uStepper S-lite a linear regulator (LDO) is used. This technology is cheap, works at ""low"" voltage differences but has a lower efficiency and thereby higher thermal dissipation than the Switch Mode regulator used on the uStepper S/S10.     uStepper S-lite with LDO and uStepper S with SW-mode regulator (graph from MCP16331 datasheet)    So, for the uStepper S with up to 42 V input voltage the LDO is not a viable solution, whereas for the S-lite with up to 12 V supply it's perfectly adequate and keeps the product price down!ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   uStepper S-lite  uStepper S-lite is recommended for NEMA 17 motors and will have all the software functionalities from the ""old"" uStepper.     uStepper S-lite pin designation     Uses most of the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>oldÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ uStepper library  Incorporates the Trinamic TMC2208 with dynamic microstepping for very smooth operation  Driver delivers 2 A current (peak)  New upgraded 328PB MCU from microchipÃÂÃÂ   12-bit encoder (0.088 degrees resolution)  Current is set in software by a simple commandÃÂÃÂ   15 I/OÃÂÃÂ   6 Analog  2 x SPIÃÂÃÂ   2 x UARTÃÂÃÂ   1 x I2CÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Voltage 6.5 - 12 V  Reverse polarity protection  Estimated retail price of ~ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬37 - ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬39 (for a basic) ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   uStepper S-lite uses the code base of the original uStepper. This will give you a lot of functionality, and some of the key ones are:   Closed loop position control  Drop-in capability (see our 3D printer application further down)  Ego-shield support (see under application further down)  Simple move/stop commands  Stall detection feedback  Encoder diagnostics  Multi-turn absolute position feedback (almost infinite revolutions)   The full list of functions can be found in our  documentation ÃÂÃÂ under ""Classes"" and ""Class List"".   Stepper driver chip   For this version we have chosen to go with the TMC2208 stepper driver, in order to keep the price of the S Lite down, while not compromising performance ! This little chip might not be the most powerful chip available, but it packs a serious punch in terms of smooth and noiseless operation, while still enabling us to reduce the product price significantly over the original uStepper.  The TMC2208 features a whopping 1/256th microstepping interpolation algorithm, which means that it takes in 1/16th microstepping pulses, as send out by most 3D printer controllers for example, and dividing each of these into 16 substeps ! This means that the rotor inside the motor travels much shorter distances between the steps, and hereby significantly reduces the resonances generated by stepper motors. This in turn ensures that you gets the smoothest possible operation while keeping the noise to an absolute minimum !   Encoder   The uStepper S Lite uses the same type of encoder as the original ustepper. This AS5600 encoder from AMS, delivers 12 bits of resolution and has done the job very well the last three years for uStepper !  We have chosen to keep using this encoder on the S Lite since it delivers great performance for the money, and it enables us to keep using the same code as the current uStepper library.   Supported accessories   The uStepper S Lite will support the EgoShield, 3D shields and prototype shield, while  the stretch goal shield for the Robots and the stretch goal of a Robot code library will not be supported by S Lite .  uStepper S  uStepper S is the upgraded version of the ""old"" uStepper, with new driver, MCU, encoder and switch mode power supply! All in all it has been improved in all aspects!     uStepper S pin designation     New driver (TMC5130 from Trinamic) with integrated ramp generator for acceleration and deceleration  Dynamic microstepping for smooth operationÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Current setting through softwareÃÂÃÂ   Driver delivers 2.5 A current (peak)  New 328PB MCU from MicrochipÃÂÃÂ   Completely new code is being developedÃÂÃÂ   New driver and code offloads MCU a lot ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> meaning more power/space for user applicationsÃÂÃÂ   New high-precision 16-bit encoder with 16X more resolution than uStepper S-lite! (0.0055 degrees resolution)  Switch mode power supply for 8-42 V supply  12 I/OÃÂÃÂ   5 AnalogÃÂÃÂ   1 x SPIÃÂÃÂ   2 x UARTÃÂÃÂ   2 x I2CÃÂÃÂ   Reverse polarity protectionÃÂÃÂ   Estimated retail price of ~ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬47 - ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬49 (for a basic) ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    Stepper driver chip   The uStepper S board contains a serious powerhouse of a stepper driver chip, the TMC5130 from Trinamic !  Furthermore, it features an native 1/256th microstepping processing engine, complete with acceleration and deceleration ramping profiles, to give smooth transition to the desired speed. The native 1/256th microstepping not only ensures low noise levels and smooth operation, it also improves the precision of your application, by reducing the smallest step size of the motor to an astonishing 0.007 degrees (assuming a motor with 200 steps per revolution)! To put this into perspective, if the motor was mounted onto a CNC machine, where the axis moves 10 mm per full rotation, this would correspond to a resolution of 0.195 microns !   Switch mode voltage regulator   In order to allow for higher motor voltages for the larger motor sizes, we have used a switch mode voltage regulator to create the 5V for the logic circuits on the PCB. By replacing the LDO of the uStepper S Lite with a switch mode regulator, the uStepper S can handle input voltages of up to 42V !  This increase in supply voltage has the benefits of increasing the stepper drivers ability to overcome the back EMF voltage generated by the motor, and hereby increasing the available torque at increasing velocities, compared to lower supply voltages.   Encoder   As the resolution of the stepper driver increases, the requirement for position sensing resolution increases aswell. Therefore we have chosen to use the newest magnetic encoder from broadcom, namely the AEAT8800-Q24.  This encoder has a 16bit resolution, which corresponds to ~0.0055 degrees ! As explained above, the encoder is used for the PID feedback loop, to correct if any steps are lost.ÃÂÃÂ   In this case, the controller reads the encoder value to determine whether a step needs to be issued (in either direction) or not. Here the driver has a resolution of 0.007 degrees, meaning that a sensor reading with a greater deviation than 0.007 degrees from the expected position results in a step needing to be generated, in order to compensate.  By using an encoder with a resolution higher than the resolution of the driver positioning, the uStepper S is able to compensate properly !   Supported accessories   The uStepper S will support the EgoShield, 3D shields, prototype shield and the stretch goal shield for the Robots as well as the stretch goal of a Robot code library.   Mounting ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   The current preferred mounting method is a snap-fit magnet bracket which just requires two bolts and two nuts!      Parts for assembly of NEMA 17 and uStepper S-lite    uStepper S-line is easily mounted with the snap-fit magnet mount bracket, and gives a tight fit!ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

These two shields will be revised to make them fit on the new uStepper S line formfactor where the pin rows have been moved a bit.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ      uStepper Ego Shield - for single axis stand-alone control    Finally, reaching one of the stretch goals below will enable us to put resources into development of a dedicated shield for the Robots!

Here we will present our most popular application examples + some new ones!  uStepper Robots   The uStepper Robot Arm, which is based on the industrial palletizer robotÃÂÃÂ was introduced during our Kickstarter campaign in 2015.  We have now developed a new version with a lot of improvements which you can read more about  HERE!   We have also developed a uStepper Delta robot whichÃÂÃÂ has the advantage of being blazing fast at moving light objects within a limited work area. This new addition to our applications you can also read more about  HERE!   Drop-in - Closed loop position control   One of the main features of uStepper is the Drop-in feature.  This feature gives your 3D printer, CNC or whatever uses an ordinary stepper driver, closed loop position control. You simply replace your driver with uStepper. uStepper takes in STEP, DIR and ENA signals from your controller, e.g. RAMPS or similar, feeds the signals through to the on-board driver while keeping an eye on actual position and correcting any mismatch between commanded and travelled steps.     uStepper Drop-in setup    So the point is that your existing controller doesn't even know uStepper is there - meaning that no adjustments in the firmware is necessary. Just replace the driver with uStepper and you are up and running in no time!ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   To describe it in short, have a look at the videos below:         You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

One of the applications for such a rail is a camera slider for making timelapse videos.  Together with our friend Alan Hinchcliffe we have developed a small shield for providing an interface for those rails being independent of a connection to a PC.ÃÂÃÂ          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Economics is outsourced - so that we have time to do what we are good at. We maintain our own shop, webpage and do all marketing material + sales our selves for now.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Besides the two of us, we have hired an engineering student (Emil) from Aalborg University to help us on the coding tasks we have on the uStepper S line.  For more details on us, press the About button on our Kickstarter profile!  Shipping &amp; Taxes  All orders are shipped from Denmark, which resides in the European Union. Because of this, we are obligated to collect 25% VAT on pledges for rewards sent to other EU member states unless you buy using a company with valid VAT number.ÃÂÃÂ    When the Kickstarter campaign has ended we will send all backers residing within the European Union an email regarding payment of VAT fee.   For backers outside the European Union, VAT is paid at the destination country - which is not under our control. Please be aware that local customs may add tax on the rewards - which is again beyond our control.  Licensing  The uStepper S Line products is an open source project, and as such the following source files will be released under the ""Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International"" license      Hardware layout/schematic source files  Software source code  uStepper mounting bracket  uStepper Robot arm parts  uStepper delta picker parts  Datasheets  etc.      Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International          Risks and challenges  We have developed and funded uStepper through Kickstarter in 2015 and sold uStepper ever since, while keeping to improve on the accessories and Arduino library. We have a very reliable manufacturer, producing great quality products and located under an hour from were we live. This ensures that we have our manufacturing and quality completely under control.  Since we have experience in developing electronics, doing the required coding, have a very reliable partner for PCB production here in Denmark and prototypes running of S-lite (and S on it's way), we don't really see any risks. One risk could of course be the shortage of components the market is experiencing right now - but our PCB production partner should have us covered! This risk will not break the project, just delay the production..."

With U.S. headquarters in Madison, Wisconsin, and offices across the world, TechDen is set to inspire a generation to reconnect with family. Welcome TechDen into your home and find balance with the screens in our lives.",1.0,2018-03-13 11:36:57 -0400,Backed 8 projects,KO,14,"-  Patent Pending  -  TechDen introduces a new way to help kids develop healthy screen habits.ÃÂÃÂ    ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s the first ever product that combines an app to manage your kidsÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> screen time with a physical home and charging station that stores their devices.ÃÂÃÂ    Our ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>out of sight, out of mindÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ approach to device management prevents kids from being distracted by text messages and notifications. Instead, theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re free to have real conversations and personal interactions.                       TechDen is designed to help families create balanced screen time that works for everyone. Based on your kidÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s schedule, you can set up sessions, which are windows of time during which they can use their device. Within each session, parents can set a maximum allowable screen time. TechDen works on a system that requires the device to be returned back to The Den. This lets kids establish a predictable routine, yet still have some flexibility. And routines that are easy to follow can eventually become habits.            Sometimes, just seeing technology can be a temptation to use it. When a childÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s device is stored inside The Den, it no longer serves as a visual cue that can trigger the desire to use it. The device remains tucked away and locked until the next pre-determined session time begins.            TechDen uses a collaborative, teaching approach thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s not authoritarian. It involves kids in many parts of the process, including scheduling, setting up rewards and physically storing their device. When kids feel a part of the device management process, theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re more likely to buy in.ÃÂÃÂ             Kids get regular notifications on their device counting down how much time they have left before itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s time to return their device to The Den. Studies show kids respond better to predictable notifications rather than the sudden ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>two-minute warningÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ parents give at arbitrary times, which often catch kids off guardÃÂÃÂ             Together, parents and children set goals and rewards for on-time returns. Children can track their own progress, which provides positive reinforcement for managing screen time and promoting a balanced relationship with their devices.ÃÂÃÂ                  The unit charges and stores up to two iOS or Android devices when not in use. It recognizes each childÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s device and notifies you which devices are charging and which are in use for better monitoring.            Easy to set up and use. It works with The Den to help parents and children manage screen time and develop healthier screen habits.                                     Thanks for supporting The Den and for helping this generation of kids develop healthier screen habits. NowÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s the time to instill a sense of balance in our kids that can last a lifetime. HereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s to a future full of responsible digital citizens.            In this age of mobile devices, itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s easy for kids to get sucked into overuse and develop bad technology habits. If youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re ready to do away with the drama surrounding managing screen time, TechDen is the solution. Soon your home will be filled with less screen time and more family time.ÃÂÃÂ               You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

As with any new technology, there was a lot of trial and error. In our case, there were a lot of pieces that had to work together: The parent app, the TechDen Jr. app and The Den.   We went through countless rounds of testing with both the development of the app, and the construction design of The Den. We recently finished the manufacturing of our second pre-production run, delivering 100 units of The Den that now work seamlessly with the app. While we continue to refine the functionality and usability of the app, we are thrilled with the product and proud to offer it to the Kickstarter community."

Plugo is our next innovation that we conceptualized after completing a successful Kickstarter campaign for our AR globe, Orboot. We create award-winning AR-based educational toys to illuminate your child's mind and, much like Orboot, Plugo will fire up your child's imagination using STEM.       After multiple rounds of developing, testing with children, incorporating feedback and upgrading ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> did we finally come up with Plugo.      Undoubtedly, Plugo is not a dream. It is now a reality.            We saw ourselves paving a path for children to learn in this tech-centered world so we launched Orboot on Kickstarter last year. The tremendous support we got from Kickstarter inspired us to come back again with a hope that our new educational toy, Plugo will steal hearts too.  Just like Orboot, Plugo will make learning super fun by using technology that children are already familiar with.  The funds raised during this campaign will help us place initial orders with our manufacturer. Every dollar counts towards making sure your child is learning while playing.

ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        Risks and challenges  We successfully delivered our last project, Orboot and learned a lot in the process. We already have prototypes of Plugo and have zeroed down on the manufacturing partners. We are confident about delivering Plugo on time. Having said that, there are always some uncertainties and risks associated with any project but we are ready with mitigation and backup plans.  We will keep the updates flowing throughout the project and be in touch with you. We are excited to see Plugo in your hands so that you can experience the quality for yourself and kids can feel the magic."

Which is the most popular Web Development language in the world?ÃÂÃÂ     Which language gets the highest pull request in Github?ÃÂÃÂ     Which language has the most popular frameworks?ÃÂÃÂ     Which language offers the most active developer community?     Well the answer to all of these questions is : ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>JavaScriptÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ.                           What are we making? ÃÂÃÂ        We are reinventing the way Full Stack JavaScript development is taught online by bringing together a complete training program which will mould anyone into a professional Fullstack Web Developer. But you gotta have the immense zeal to learn!  This E-Degree program is an immersive learning experience which involves a sequence of self driven courses, mentor driven projects, quizzes and exams to ensure concept assimilation, constant course updatation, expert webinars and much more. We have envisioned a program which is modern, engaging and will make our students market ready!ÃÂÃÂ   Why this Fullstack E-Degree?        1) Build  real-world projects all on your own!ÃÂÃÂ    Undoubtedly, working in teams is great but when working on a personal project it is necessary to have the knowledge of the entire development stack to bring your idea to life. After this program you can do everything from UI development to Server side coding and Database designing! You will end up being a strong one-man army resulting in speeding up things dramatically without being dependent on anyone. You can manage the frontend, UI, and the back-end for all the projects by yourself.    2) Jobs are no longer in silos.ÃÂÃÂ    A frontend developer is no longer just a front-end developer, but he also needs to have an understanding about all the other aspects of development as well. Similarly, a backend developer needs to aware about the front-end technologies to create better products for companies. The lines between job descriptions are now blurred, and having the knowledge of a complete full stack developer gives you an edge over other developers ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> something a lot of companies are now looking for!     3) Full stack allows you to be more productive.ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ An in-depth knowledge about all the main pillars of development allows you to create better web solutions which scale and produce efficient code.ÃÂÃÂ    4) Better Salary.ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ Companies are no longer looking to hire different developers for one website or an app, they prefer if one person can do it all with a generous package! This is why the demand for full stack developers that can perform multiple tasks together is definitely something that translates into high-scale financial opportunities. Full stack developers are currently raking in over $125,000 annually!   5) Javascript is a fun language!ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ It is very expressive, you don't have to spend lot of time learning complex coding syntax. There are even additional languages that are built upon Javascript such as Typescript that offer more features. You just have to play around with itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s different aspects to create magic!     What this program contains?   We have carefully chosen the content of this program to ensure that the student gets all the essential conceptual knowledge followed by tons of practical examples. The first and the most important part of the training program isÃÂÃÂ self driven courses.   Self Driven Courses-   These courses have been designed and taught by experts from all over the world.

We have every expectation that this will be a seamless production process; however, we want to make sure you aware of the potential risks."

We are 2 founders and are backed by our family who are all dental professionals.,1.0,2018-06-21 14:05:27 -0400,Backed 0 projects,KO,2,"Did you ever wonder which electric toothbrush would be more accurate to your dental needs?  There are 2 main technology or action available on the market: Rotary (most of Oral-BÃÂÃÂ® electric toothbrushes) and Sonic (most of Philips SonicareÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ toothbrushes) and they each have pros and cons.  Therefore we totally understandÃÂÃÂ the dilemma of choosing one or the other since they will actually define your dental hygiene.ÃÂÃÂ        Most of the time you either follow your dentist advise - which you should - orÃÂÃÂ randomly buy any electric toothbrush thinking that getting rid off the manual brushing is already a huge achievement.ÃÂÃÂ   The problem is that some dental professionals would support more an action than another simply because of their understanding of the product or even their relationship with Oral-B or Philips vendors.ÃÂÃÂ   There are countless of official studies that show the benefits of rotary over sonic and about the same amount bragging advantages of sonic over rotary.ÃÂÃÂ Growing up in a family of dentists, orthodontics and hygienist I can tell you that the best is actually having both action, simply because they each have features than the other one doesn't offer.ÃÂÃÂ        However due to the pricetag of these electric devices only the richest would be able to afford buying both an Oral-BÃÂÃÂ® and a Philips SonicareÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ electric toothbrush.ÃÂÃÂ   That's why we created RotasonicÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ brush heads, to let you access the missing action by unlocking your existing electric toothbrush. Just swap a RotasonicÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ brush head instead on your Oral-BÃÂÃÂ® electric toothbrush to get the sonic action instead of buying a Philips SonicareÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ electric toothbrush to get the sonic action.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Rotasonic V1 brush heads are compatible with your Oral-BÃÂÃÂ® electric toothbrush to give them a Sonic action. We have just fully developed the Rotasonic V1 and are ready to ship these brush heads immediately after the campaign.ÃÂÃÂ        Don't choose anymore between Rotary or Sonic action for your teeth, just get them both for a very affordable price.  Oral-BÃÂÃÂ® users, just plug a Rotasonic head and enjoy a great sonic brushing.ÃÂÃÂ   Thank you for supporting this campaign!  Yohan and theÃÂÃÂ RotasonicÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ Team      Risks and challenges  As you can see through this campaign, products are already designed, developed and tested.

It is free and runs in the web browser, you can start right away. It's easy to use, so you don't need to have coded ever before to begin using it and creating beautiful and exciting patterns. If you have coding experience, you can dive deep into the capabilities of TurtleStitch.  You can share your embroidery code on TurtleStitch's online platform and also explore or build upon the code of others. Use a standard embroidery machine locally to embroider your favourite textiles. Now you can wear your code!  TurtleStitch is inspired by MIT Scratch, builds upon Berkeley Snap! and we collaborate closely with Beetleblocks.             What was our motivation to create and offer TurtleStitch?   We did the first steps in project development out of curiosity. Realising how many different possibilities emerged out of creating line-based embroidery designs, we simply couldn't stop exploring further. As we have been active in Software Design for children in earlier projects, we saw a big potential to engage boys and girls through a new approach to learn coding.  We decided to go for a block-based coding interface to open up the pattern design for beginners. Additionally, we developed a sharing platform for the embroideries, so that everybody can scroll through designs and learn from and build upon others code.  It is great to see that users from all over the world have started to use the tool and our userbase is continuously growing. Based on a lot of user feedback in workshops and online, we know where to improve the functionality and the learning potential of the tool.

Today we'r excited to release the revised version 1.3 of Raspiboy !       Raspiboy was launched last year on Kickstarter. Since we have done some improvements, especially :  - Battery management system  - Gamepad sensitivity  - And for the revision release here's a clear purple case limited edition :)  We'll come back to that at the end, but first for those who don't know yet Raspiboy :ÃÂÃÂ   What is Raspiboy ?   RaspiBoy is a handheld emulation console kit based on raspberry pi zero.       The idea came when I saw on internet projects of ""GameBoyZero"", awesome raspberry pi based consoles. I was amazed, but it looked pretty difficult to build one, it was a 3 months work and over 100ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ for all components! And last, you need an old gameboy to rip open.  RaspiBoy is conceived such that everything fits together perfectly and the build is a 5 minutes task without soldering!  The RaspiBoy comes as a kit, with easy assembly tutorial video. Don't worry ! It's super easy and we will guide you step by step. It's very much like a puzzle ! Moreover I hope you will find the tutorial interesting as there will be lot of interesting facts on product design, PCB design, prototyping and so on!       (Why a kit? Because we simply cannot include the raspberry pi zero (5ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬) as it is only sold 1 raspberry pi zero max per customer.)  And isn't it cool to be able to say that you made your own handheld game station ? ;)         But wait! You are saying that we can play any game of our childhood, what does it mean exactly? Does the kit comes with games integrated?  I do not supply any software or game, there are several emulation station softwares that you can install (super easy installation, it will be explained step-by-step in the tutorial!), for example Retropie or RecalBox. You can check them on Youtube for demo !  Those softwares come with a wide range of systems supported : Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, Super Nintendo, Megadrive (Genesis), Atari, MaMe and so on. You can have a look  here  to all the supported systems.  To install a game you need it's ROM file. A ROM file is a computer file containing all the game data. You can legally download ROM of any unlicensed games on the internet.  Then to install the ROM you just have to put the ROM file on a USB-key and plug it into the RaspiBoy. That's it ! (copy and installation is automatic!)  Features    We tried to add as much nice features as possible in this RaspiBoy! Here is an overview :    TV output  : you can connect RaspiBoy to your big TV with the mini-HDMI connector and video automatically switch from RaspiBoy to your TV!           Up to 4 players  : you can connect USB gamepads on RaspiBoy! (3 players with basic kit and 4 players with extra-usb kit, see below)          Speaker + headphone jack + Thumbwheel potentiometer to tune volumeÃÂÃÂ   4 LED for battery status    And what does the RaspiBoy kit include exactly?  Everything you need to build your game console but the Raspberry Pi Zero!  We have 2 kits : the ""Basic Kit"" and the ""Fully Loaded Kit"". Both of them include the default components :ÃÂÃÂ     The RaspiBoy designed plastic casingÃÂÃÂ          ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ Available in 2 colors : Grey or clear purple Kickstarter Limited Edition. You'll have to choose at the end of Kickstarter.         3.5"" LCD screen  to display the composite signal of pi zero           Game controller board and buttonsÃÂÃÂ            8BCraft revised electronic board. V1.3           ÃÂÃÂ  Speaker         Then the battery, memory size and option change depend on kit :ÃÂÃÂ   Basic kit        Default components (see below)    8GB  memory card, which is enought for thousands of your games !   3000mAh  3.7V Lithium battery (about 4.5 hours of battery life)         Fully loaded kit        Default components (see below)ÃÂÃÂ    32GB  memory card, which is enought for even more of your games !   6000mAh  3.7V Lithium battery (about 9 hours of battery life)          EXTRA USB KIT :ÃÂÃÂ  The original kit only have 2 external USB (not enough room on the electronic board!), so 3 players maximum. With this kit you can add one extra USB connector to your RaspiBoy to play up to 4 players. This part require soldering!           3 USB gamepads         ÃÂÃÂ   ***  Again please note that the Raspberry Pi zero is not included in any kits . It is very cheap, only 5$, and we will give you instruction how to get yours. We can't include it in the kit because it is only sold 1 raspberry pi zero per customer/order and we can't get any supply of it !***  Kickstarter limited edition!   Raspiboy is now available in 2 colors : Grey or clear purple Kickstarter Limited Edition !  You'll have to choose the color at the end of Kickstarter.  Limited edition will be CLEAR PURPLE color.                      This limited edition will be available only on Kickstarter, so don't miss it ;)  Upgrade from 8GB to 16GB for free!  Basic Raspiboy kit comes with 8GB SD card, which can already hold hundreds of games.   Upgrade from 8GB to 16GB memory for FREE  by sharing Raspiboy kickstarter on facebook!ÃÂÃÂ   Copy the URL of your facebook post and save it for later. At the end of the Kickstarter I will send you a survey to ask you about shipping details and color, there you will be able to put your URL to get the free memory card upgrade!       If you'r going for the fully loaded kit if you can share just because you like the project it's aweome! :)  What is new with revised version v1.3 ?  We have improved a lot of things since our first Kickstarter!ÃÂÃÂ   The main improvement is definitly the charge system, with the first revised v1.2 we enabled the possibility to play and charge at the same time. But the charge with the new system was very long because of excessive heating. In order to solve this issue we added 2 internal copper layers in the PCB that act as heatsink, draining the heat from the charger chip. Thus the charge cycle is improved and is almost twice faster! Full charge is now 4-5 hours while it was about 8-12 hours with the v1.2 of the PCB.       The second improvement we have made is to replace the gamepad PCB that had a lot of sensitivity issues, we are now using one which react way better.  Then there are a lot of small changes that helps improving the reliability of the system and reduce the defect rate.  More than a gadget, a journey  Joining me on kickstarter is not only about getting a nice game console. It's also about the journey of the project! As you can check on my two first Kickstarter campaigns  Raspiboy  and  RetroStone , I made a point to give good updates (check for yourself  HERE ). With interesting facts on production. ÃÂÃÂ   Here are exemples of what people thought of them!       Also Raspiboy already have a lot of reviews that you can check  HEREÃÂÃÂ    Raspiboy is a KIT please be aware of that!   If you are looking for an assembled product then you'r not looking for Raspiboy!  Please note that electronic is delicate, might broke while assembly and sometime even be frustrating if assembly is not done correctly.  If you don't feel up to the task then you might be interested in  RetroStone  ( check here !) that we just launched on Kickstarter earlier this year!ÃÂÃÂ RetroStone is an assembled handheld.ÃÂÃÂ        Retrostone similar with Raspiboy. There are few differences though :ÃÂÃÂ        -ÃÂÃÂ Raspiboy use a raspberry pi zero, so you can use the official Retropie or Recalbox. Whereas RetroStone use a H3 processor which run Retrorangepi, a Retropie build for Armbian (which is definitly awesome too), but so far Recalbox is not supported on H3.  - RetroStone is 135ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ where Raspiboy starts at 75ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ (even 65ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ on the Kickstarter!)  - RetroStone has an easy memory card access       RetroStone is up for pre-order on my website  HERE ÃÂÃÂ   (PS:ÃÂÃÂ  Raspiboy orders on the website are v1.2)  Why getting a Raspiboy? It can be :   For yourself and to have some good fun with friends.ÃÂÃÂ   To make a gift to a special someone.ÃÂÃÂ   To discover the world of hackerspaces, fablabs and raspberry pi with a nice project. We made the tuto very clear and with lot of interresting facts!ÃÂÃÂ   To build an arcade station for your kids and impress them with a cool gift they won't forget !   Playfull learningÃÂÃÂ   The Raspiboy comes as a kit and it's a good opportunity to learn a lot. And that's for me the most important feature!! I think a lot of people are afraid of electronic DIY.ÃÂÃÂ   With this kit, you don't need to be an expert or to have a solder iron. If you ever wanted to discover the world of DIY, fablab, hackerspace and so on, this is a good start!ÃÂÃÂ   Indeed we want this kit to be very instructive on different subjects:   Product design: how to think your productÃÂÃÂ   3D designÃÂÃÂ   Prototyping: electronic prototyping,ÃÂÃÂ 3D printing  ÃÂÃÂ Indeed we want this kit to be very instructive on different subjects:Electronics design : from idea to prototypeÃÂÃÂ    Schedule :   End of July 2018 : End of Kickstarter  August 2018 : Production  September 2018 : Testing and preparing kits  End of septembre 2018 : Shipping to you guys  As this is the revised version for Raspiboy there are lot of things that will be easier and faster. For exemple to injection mold is already ready. Suppliers are already selected and tested. So everything should be smooth! :)      Risks and challenges  Raspiboy already became a reality thanks to kickstarter backers last year! Which means that everything is ready to start the production of the revised version, all we need now is to get enought backers to start a production!  Back us now and help us reach our fundraising goal so that we can launch the production! :)"

DUO is plug and display. Simply plug DUO into your laptop, and youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re ready to boost your productivity by up to 50%!       DUO provides a full 270ÃÂÃÂ° rotation, with the option for a 180ÃÂÃÂ° presentation mode, so you can choose your optimum viewing angle for any situation. You can also slide DUO to either side of your laptop screen.       DUO was created with high-quality industry materials and can withstand the wear and tear that comes with transporting your laptop around.       At 1.5 pounds, DUO gives you the true mobility you need to move from workspace to workspace.       The DUO video driver has an energy-star rating to reduce battery drain from your laptop.       DUO is compatible with any laptop via simple USB connection and available in a 12.5-inch size to best fit your laptop.       DUO has a 1080p high-resolution display, so everything you see is crisp and clear.            ÃÂÃÂ            Toggling between tabs, windows, and applications can make us lose, on average, about 10 seconds every five minutes.

Unfortunately, a second desktop monitor doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t help employees when they work from home or travel.

While working at Amazon, DUOÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s creator, Jack, was constantly frustrated by the lack of a secondary monitor that could help him work more efficiently. Feeling strangely nostalgic about the work monitor he used at his previous job, he decided to build a laptop monitor from a broken laptop.                                During the process, he realized that most of the secondary monitors available were stationary, and he couldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t move around with them. So, he built a prototype of a light and portable monitor that he could carry anywhere with him.                      Soon, everyone in the office wanted one, and our product, DUO, was born!

ÃÂÃÂ   Not technically, LIMBO is pure magic. Just imagine taking an innocent looking spinning top, that looks and feels like any other, give it a spin, waiting for it to fall, but instead of falling- looking at it spin for hours.            Just as the true value of a camera is not the camera itself, but the photos and moments it captures, the true value of LIMBO is its ability to amaze and elicit a WOW response from your surroundings.ÃÂÃÂ   Plus, watching LIMBO spin is really relaxing and enables you to take a tiny break from reality.                      Spins on surfaces others won't and accelerates at will  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ Click Below to Watch the Full VideoÃÂÃÂ ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¬<U+0087>           ÃÂÃÂ Each LIMBO has its own unique characteristics, making it look, feel and spin a little differently. And when you hold each one, the contrast between them really accentuates just how special each one really is. We really want you all to experience the full LIMBO spectrum, so we made a special high-value Double, Triple and an 'All-4' reward for the collectors and the curious.            ÃÂÃÂ LIMBO doesn't need a special base- as you can see above, any tomato or coin will do :)  With that said, there are lots of advantages to having a LIMBO base:  1.ÃÂÃÂ  An Elevated Experience . The base was designed specifically for LIMBO, with a surface that has just the right texture and right amount of friction, enabling LIMBO to spin (even more) beautifully and takes care of LIMBOÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s point of contact, the tip.  2.ÃÂÃÂ  Prevents LIMBO from Getting Lost . The base is your LIMBOÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s uh, home-base space. And a home-base means you know where it is, displayed beautifully and prominently, not lost amongst all your table things.  3.  Your LIMBO Spin-Pad . Unfortunately, most tables are not perfectly balanced :( ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why after a few minutes, LIMBO often finds itself spinning on the floor. Or on some loud spot on the desk. It's still cool, and a side effect of a top that spins for hours. But we think spinning in place on the desk is even cooler. Maybe weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re just classy like that  Some base details: ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s made from high-quality ABS Plastic and crafted using CNC machining. ÃÂÃÂ             Our vision for this kit is to provide the GUINNESS WORLD RECORD experience in your own environment. It's perfect for special events when you feel the need to amaze your surroundings.ÃÂÃÂ   In addition to the WR mechanism, you'll receive a standard rechargeable mechanism for everyday use that works with the same casing.   Included items:ÃÂÃÂ    1x Titanium top (casing only) 1x WR mechanism 1x standard mechanism (with a rechargeable battery) 4x non-rechargeable batteries (for the WR mechanism) 1x USB charging cable 1x LIMBO base (color of your choice)   * LIMBO WR can spin for over 40 hours, so you can set your own record :) ** Extra batteries will be available on our website when the campaign is over *** If you're interested in switching to the LIMBO WR kit, you can do so by clicking the ""Manage"" button. Feel free to contact us if you need help                                          ÃÂÃÂ We used some really advanced new algorithms to make sure LIMBO spins perfectly with maximum spin time. We also had to minimize the power used by the motor and the processor's frequency. We'll be sharing some more of the details and techniques behind the project in the campaign updates, so stay tuned!            Unscrew LIMBOÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s casing to reveal a standard micro-USB connection just below the surface            ÃÂÃÂ * The LIMBO keychain comes will all LIMBO and LIMBO black models.                              As a backer, you can rest assured that you can upgrade your pledge, change your address and payment info without any stress.              ÃÂÃÂ                                Risks and challenges  As with all Kickstarter projects, some risks are entailed. However, we've spent months testing many Limbo prototypes and perfecting our production line to ensure minimum risk.  We're dedicated to getting Limbo to all our backers on time and at the highest quality."

These contaminated sites are often called Brownfield's, many of which are old gas stations. We want to clean them up so the land can be utilized for something that makes our communities a better place. Our solution requires substantial time and a large financial investment. It's high risk, but also extremely high reward...it could be a game changer, and a major win for the environment and our communities.  As a startup with a big idea, time &amp; money do not come easily...so we set out to develop a product that would allow us to become self-sustianble in a business sense. In the relatively small town of Winter Park, Florida we began designing an electric bike we thought could help influence more people to ditch the car for all journeys less than 5 miles.ÃÂÃÂ A large portion of soil pollution has been caused by industry, run-off, and cars - so riding a bike locally reduces your impact. You are preventing further pollution and are a part of the solution too.  Our Team  Ari Davis and Walker Haymaker co-founded 'The Soil Company' with the purpose of creating healthier communities. Ari is a Kiwi (New Zealander) who has an immense respect for the soil and was fortunate to have grown up in a family that was obsessed with growing fruits and veggies in their backyard. Walker grew up in a family that has farms in Georgia and has a deep appreciation for maintaining healthy communities. The rest of our team consists of dedicated individuals who are committed to a society that creates  shared value for all stakeholders.  They come from all walks of life and are inspirational people who share a common passion for doing good and elevating their communities.

We're happy you found our Kickstarter Page :-)ÃÂÃÂ         1. ABOUT OUR PROJECT   Some Key Words   Personalized skincare  Based on your DNA &amp; lifestyle  DNA analysis as an objective &amp; robust analysis tool  Unique skin, unique skincare   Selective choice of ingredients  Complete anti-aging treatment   Targeted approach to your skin concerns        Nomige understands better than anyone what your skin needs. We make personalized skin care products and carefully select ingredients that suit your skin. In doing so we take into account your DNA, as well as your lifestyle. This exact approach will revitalize your skin, making it radiant and in so doing visibly reduce the signs of ageing.   2. NOMIGE IN TWO MINUTES: OUR PITCHÃÂÃÂ        Are you interested in our project, but you don't have the time to read everything? No problem, we made a summary from our brand in two minutes. Watch the video above :)ÃÂÃÂ    3. EXPLORE NOMIGE - OUR CONCEPT      You are UNIQUE    You are unique. That also applies to your skin. But when you look at the offer in care products they are categorized in merely 4 skin types; dry skin, oily skin, mixed skin and sensitive skin.Nomige takes skin care to the next level and offers highly personalized products. No standard categories but an individual approach. Your skin is determined by your DNA and your lifestyle. Your DNA can tell us a lot, it contains valuable information about your skin. For example, we can see if 'by nature' you are prone to dry skin, or that this is simply the result of your lifestyle &amp; habits. By mapping your DNA, we can tailor ingredients specifically to your DNA profile. That way, your skin gets exactly what it needs.         ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  2.1.ÃÂÃÂ  WHY DNA?     DNA - Fingerprint - Logo    Your DNA is the core or the basis of your existence. It's the blueprint that makes you who you are. It contains all information about how you look and function. A unique code that makes you a unique person. Every piece of information has its place on your DNA in the form of genes. Every gene represents a specific characteristic. Genes determine eye colour, but also your skin type and the way in which your skin ages. The analysis or reading of your genes therefore offers insights that cannot be discovered in any other way.   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ  2.2.ÃÂÃÂ  INTO THE SCIENCE   Skin ageing is determined by 2 factors: your DNA and your lifestyle.    Intrinsic skin ageing accounts for 60%, while 40% is due to external factors and your lifestyle. Pollution, unhealthy food, bad care products, ... these are just a few examples of external factors that determine the condition of your skin.        ÃÂÃÂ   In order to be able to determine the right skin type, it is important to have a complete picture of your DNA &amp; lifestyle.  By nature  you can have a well hydrated skin, but due to using aggressive skin care products or as a result of changing seasons your skin can still feel dry.   We determine your genetic skin profile by investigating different genes involved in your skin aging process. We identify the presence of mutations/variations in genes involved in collagen homeostasis, antioxidant protection, barrier function and skin hydration.   Collagen: Collagen is the most important structural protein of the extracellular matrix and is responsible for the firmness and elasticity of your skin.     Antioxidants: Tissue damage by free radicals is one of the main causes of accelerated skin aging. Free radicals are formed due to external stress factors, such as tobacco, pollution or exposure to UV radiation. Depending on your level of antioxidants, those free radicals can be neutralized before they can cause any damage.ÃÂÃÂ   Hydration &amp; Skin barrier function :  A well hydrated skin shows less wrinkles and is often less prone to irritation. In addition, the moisture balance has an important role to keep your barrier function intact.   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ  2.3.ÃÂÃÂ  THE PRODUCTS  On the basis of your DNA profile and your lifestyle we select the right ingredients for your skin. Only ingredients that your skin needs and that target your specific shortage.   We put together an Exclusive Nomige package that consists of 4 personalized products. Each product has its specific target, focusing on compensating 'defects' in the biological processes of skin ageing described above.    Day serum - Based on your DNA.Antioxidant booster with ingredients that compensate for variations in your antioxidant genes.   Day Cream- Based on your lifestyle. Lifestyle Blend with UV protection and other ingredients that match your lifestyle.  Night Cream- Based on your DNA.Collagen booster with ingredients that compensate for variations in your collagen genes.  Night Serum - Based on your DNA. Hydration booster with ingredients that compensate for variations in your hydration &amp; barrier function genes.

Each product contains specific ingredients that purposefully compensate for your genetic defects.       Nomige uses specific and high quality peptides (Sederma) to boost collagen or suppress its breakdown, when &amp; where needed. An observational study with such peptides shows that after 8 weeks there is a significant visible reduction in the number of wrinkles, as well as the depth of the wrinkles due to an increase in collagen.     before - after         ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    4.

HOW IT ALL STARTED             EMPOWERED by the discouraging search for the right skin care products.   INSPIRED by the uniqueness of every person.   DRIVEN by the scientific knowledge about skin.   Nomige founder Dr. Barbara Geusens used these elements to start her own brand. A brand that represents objective truth. A brand that is literally inspired by who you are.   NOMIGE is the first Belgian brand that offers customized face care products based on your DNA and your personal lifestyle.ÃÂÃÂ           7. ABOUT THE FOUNDER      Dr. Barbara Geusens - founder &amp; CEO of Nomige    Barbara Geusens is born and raised in Bree (Belgium) and lives with her husband Stijn and son William in Ghent. She is a biomedical engineer and holds a PhD degree in dermatological sciences.   After a long and unsuccessful search for the right skin care products, Dr. Barbara Geusens decided to create her own skin care product line that would meet her high expectations. Products that focused on anti-ageing as well as minor skin concerns and that contained ingredients your skin really needs.Her personal story, her scientific knowledge and her strong belief that every skin is unique were the motives to launch NOMIGE.          8.

We have a close relationship with all our clients and from their feedback we learn and improve. The process is 'on demand'. This means that every order is processed individually and consecutively. Our very dedicated work is also very time consuming.  In order to grow and serve more customers worldwide, we need to invest. Investments are needed to speed up processes, make them more efficient and do things in parallel, rather than consecutively.ÃÂÃÂ    First of all, we want to invest in research and development. We have mapped over 3700 theoretical skin profiles and in order to serve clients faster, we want to set theory into practice.   Secondly, we need to scale-up. From small batches to mid-size batches, again to speed up the process and serve more clients in parallel.  Lastly, going hand in hand with the previous one, we need to invest in raw materials and (new) packaging.   Below you find the detailed break down of how we will use your funding to finance the all of the above.ÃÂÃÂ   We are looking for 25 000ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ to finance our project:    21% of this amount will go to VAT  8% to the crowdfunding platform    30% goes to R&amp;D    20% will be spent for purchase of raw materials    10% is for packaging    11% will be invested in optimizing &amp; setting up production          Your help and investments will allow us to enlarge our current client base in Belgium and in addition expand internationally by entering new markets and selling cross border.ÃÂÃÂ   If you feel you want to help realize this project, my dream, please support us. We will be forever grateful &lt;3   9. SOME INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SHIPPING COSTS.     You might be surprised by the high shipping costs, that is why we want to give you a little more information.

This is a passion project which came about through product development &amp; engineering. We have built and tested numerous assemblies from our favorite vintage synths for the purpose of studying the intricacies of each design. After testing, these parts are generally used in our in-house machines or neatly stored away. In the case of the OB-X, employees &amp; visitors alike were asking to remake these parts. Since we are not in the primary business of selling parts or kits it took some convincing. These designs are completely finished. We've established a goal of $10k to make sure we have enough quantity to hit our pricing targets. If the goal is reached at the end of the funding period we will immediately send out for the parts to be made. We do not anticipate offering these parts for sale in the future. This project is more of a give-back to the vintage synth community as opposed to a practical money-making venture.ÃÂÃÂ   Before getting into the details of the actual parts we'll clearly state what is being offered. We are offering various voice-related parts for the OB-X and synthesizer, including bare PCB's, fully assembled PCB's, and fully assembled kits.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    *OBX Voice Card PCB  *OBX Voice Card PCB Assembly  *OBX Motherboard PCB  *OBX Motherboard PCB Assembly  *OBX Motherboard TrayÃÂÃÂ   *OBX 4-Voice Expansion Kit  *OBX 8-Voice Kit  *OBXÃÂÃÂ Filter Control Board AssemblyÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ     Voice Card PCB    The *OBX Voice Card PCB is interchangeable with original parts.ÃÂÃÂ The layout is the same with the following improvements.   ENIG Gold surface finish.   Double-sided black soldermask.   Support for multi-mode filter. The 'Noise Half &amp; Full' buttons can be used to select filter modes.  This option requires our Motherboard PCB and Filter Control Board. No other modifications required.    Placements for 25-turn Bourns potentiometers for VCO adjustments  Placements forÃÂÃÂ LM7815/7915 1.5A voltage regulators to upgrade the original 78L15/79L15 parts.   Placements for Panasonic FC radial capacitors to upgrade the original axial components.    BOM ÃÂÃÂ and  Schematics ÃÂÃÂ available for parts procurement, costing, &amp; assembly.       Voice Card PCB Assembly ÃÂÃÂ   The *OBX Voice Card PCB Assembly is fully populated, calibrated, and ready for use. Parts selection andÃÂÃÂ substitutions versus the original parts are detailed below:   All IC placements include machined IC sockets.ÃÂÃÂ   New old stock CA3086.ÃÂÃÂ  KRL tempco's are thermally bonded to the transistor array as on the original parts.   New old stock CA3080E.   New old stock Panasonic 'tropical fish' capacitors in the audio path.   CEM3310's are replaced with the AS3310. We have a relationship with Alfa Rpar and have been testing and spec'ing several of their new parts in our products currently in development.ÃÂÃÂ  The AS3310 performs the same as the original parts.  Bourns 25-turn trimmers are used for VCO-related calibrations.  ST LM9815CV &amp; LM7915CV 1.5A voltage regulators replace the original 100mA parts.  Panasonic FC capacitors replace the original axial local power supply capacitors.  Polyester Film Capacitors are used for the envelope generator timing caps. They are the same tolerance and same characteristics as the original metallized polyester caps used.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ          Motherboard PCB  ÃÂÃÂ   The *OBX Motherboard PCB is interchangeable with original parts. Improvements include:   ENIG Gold surface finish.ÃÂÃÂ   Double-sided black soldermask.   Support for multi-mode filter.ÃÂÃÂ     BOM  and  Schematics  available for parts procurement, costing, &amp; assembly.       ÃÂÃÂ  Motherboard PCB Assembly ÃÂÃÂ   The *OBX Motherboard PCB Assembly is fully populated and calibrated ready for use. Parts selection and substitutions versus the original parts are detailed below:   All IC placements include machined IC sockets.  Connectors are square tin-plated brass versus the original round tin-plated nickel pins. The female connector also has a higher tension constant than the original discontinued parts. These assemblies are more robust and should not become intermittent over the decades.   Additional connector installed to supportÃÂÃÂ multi-mode filter.      Please note there are two versions for the motherboard assembly.ÃÂÃÂ    The *OBX Motherboard Assembly (Expansion) is to be used for voices 5-8 and not as the primary motherboard (voices 1-4). As on the original synth, only the parts that are required are installed.ÃÂÃÂ   The *OBX Motherboard Assembly (Primary) is to be used for voices 1-4 as the primary motherboard (voices 1-4). As on the original synth, all parts are installed and the assembly is calibrated.       ÃÂÃÂ  Motherboard TrayÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ   This is the metal tray that is used for voices 5-8. It is powder-coated in black. This part is the same as the original part.         4-Voice Expansion Kit ÃÂÃÂ   Fully assembled and calibrated 4-voice expansion. This includes four *OBX Voice Card Assemblies, one *OBX Motherboard Assembly (Expansion), one Motherboard Tray, and all connectors and hardware needed to upgrade a 4-voice OB-X to 8 voices.ÃÂÃÂ    Please note: If multi-mode filter support is desired the Filter Control Board Assembly is also required.         8-Voice Kit ÃÂÃÂ   Fully assembled and calibrated 8-voice retrofit. This includes eight *OBX Voice Card Assemblies, one *OBX Motherboard Assembly (Primary), one *OBX Motherboard Assembly (Expansion), one Motherboard Tray, one Filter Control Board Assembly, and all connectors and hardware needed to retrofit an OB-X with eight new voices with multi-mode filter support.ÃÂÃÂ   Filter Control Board Assembly  This assembly is only needed if the multi-mode filter option is going to be used. This option requires our *OBX Voice Cards and *OBX Motherboard.ÃÂÃÂ  This board replaces component A31 on the OB-X Control Board. It contains two switches which determine the function of the Noise 'Half' &amp; 'Full' buttons. The switches are readily accessible under the lid without having to move any parts. The switches allow for several modes:    Mode 1 : Both noise half and full level are  disabled . All filter mode selections are  enabled , including low-pass, high-pass, and bandpass.     Mode 2 : Noise full level is  enabled  and noise half level is  disabled . High-pass filter mode is  enabled , bandpass filter mode is  disabled . This allows for both full level noise noise and high-pass filter to be used.ÃÂÃÂ    Mode 3 :ÃÂÃÂ Both noise half and full volume are  enabled . Filter mode selections are  disabled . This is the default standard OB-X mode.   ÃÂÃÂ  Please note: The majority of OB-X's have component A31 socketed. This makes installation easy. However, there are some OB-X's that do not have A31 socketed. In this case the original part will have to be removed first for the new filter mod control board can be installed.    Please note: This board can also be used as a convenient way to tap into the latches on A31 for custom mods and diy.    Schematic  available for reference.        Stretch Goal   If funding reaches $25k we will be offering parts &amp; assemblies for a full rack enclosure, front end, and power supply to build your own *OBX rack. We have already developed a front end for testing our *OBX parts but need to raise enough funds to make it worthwhile to dedicate resources to finish development on the full kit.ÃÂÃÂ   The *OBX rack kit will consist of the following:   Rack Enclosure with front panelÃÂÃÂ   Panelboard PCB &amp; BOM for building the front end  Motherboard PCB Assemblies for rack version  I/O board PCB Assembly  Power Supply Assembly   Estimated budget for these parts &amp; assemblies is $995.   Do Not purchase *OBX Motherboards if looking to build the rack version, alternate motherboards would be used.        ÃÂÃÂ    Disclaimer: We are offering these parts for the vintage Oberheim OB-X Synthesizer. The current status of the ownership of the original Oberheim name, logo, and the ""OB-X"" name are not known. Gibson, the most recent owner, is now in bankruptcy and is owned by a group of financial companies. We have specifically avoided using the original company name ""Oberheim"" and original model name ""OB-X"" in the naming of our parts. It may also be necessary to remove the brand and model name from the production PCB's. ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  These parts have already completed design verification and are ready to be manufactured. However, the last step of documentation and delivery  is not to be underestimated. The risk relates to delivery time. Delivery dates for some may shift depending on the number of parts that are ordered. Assemblies will be delivered in the order of pledge date. With the small number of OB-X's out there we don't expect delays to be significant."

Later in Massachusetts, Brimhall was the Executive Director of the Massachusetts Prison Art Project, one of the first such programs in the country and one that was heavily supported by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, National Endowment for the Arts and an extensive Boston-area corporate community. Her career also encompassed serving as the director of the Artists-in-Schools Program for the Massachusetts State Arts Council.Brimhall went on to serve as a senior leader in several major Boston healthcare organizations, including as Director of Development for both Planned Parenthood, during their first capital campaign, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, during a $57M capital campaign where she also oversaw plans for a new $125M+ campaign for medical education.

Best Methods for Retention (Source: National Training Laboratory)    Change LabÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s online lessons enable fundraisers to learn by doing, master proven strategies, and refine the skills that can change the future for their cause. Gamified training provides the unique opportunity for learning through trial and error without consequences.This allows you to hone your skills by working through real-life scenarios without risking support for your cause.  We have worked on this concept for years ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> in our free moments and whenever else we could ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> to refine our ideas for maximum impact. We are committed to creating a product that not only looks amazing, but also fosters lasting results.    Our Focus on Nonprofits: Supporting a Growing Industry     Nonprofit Sector Growth    ÃÂÃÂ The nonprofit sector has been growing at an amazing rate over the past 15+ years. As more and more organizations are relied upon to provide essential and transformative services, and waves of potential employees look for more meaningful career paths, this growth will not slow anytime soon.     Nonprofits: How much do they raise, and how do they raise it?    ÃÂÃÂ For the million-plus nonprofits in the US, fundraising provides the critical operating capital necessary to carry out their missions. Each year, these organizations raise hundreds of billions of dollars - it is no small feat for the fundraisers, executives, and volunteers charged with bringing in the support their organizations need to thrive.  Change Lab is starting out with Major Gifts training in response to the immense impact that area can have for an organization. Major Gifts has high stakes, and huge rewards - done correctly, it can be a game-changer for any nonprofit.  What's Next?  After successfully completing our Kickstarter, we are going to work with our technical partners to complete a fully-functioning prototype to share with potential investors. From there, we will get the funding necessary to complete the entire Major Gifts module. Then comes time for beta testing and refinement before going out to the world and rolling out the final product.  We want to revolutionize fundraising training. We hope you will join us.  What about those rewards?  We all know that selfless generosity is its own reward, but here are a few snapshots in case you are interested...

This project has been a dream of ours for years now. By supporting Change Lab, you are supporting the nonprofit industry, and we think that it is pretty amazing of you.      Risks and challenges  Our main challenge is working in a new medium. While we did not start off with much knowledge about what it takes to create web-based, visually engaging games and lessons, we have learned an awful lot over the past few years. Most importantly, we learned what exactly it is that we do not know, and what we need to look for in visual and technical partners.   We have assembled a team of amazing animators, character artists, and graphic designers who will work with our equally amazing programmers and tech wizards.   We are still wrapping up the content underpinning the lessons, and working on fleshing out the visual presentation, but we are confident in our ability to execute, and know it is just a matter of time and effort before we come out with something amazing."

Hundreds of people take part in our nine-day events, mixing experts trying out new ideas and technology and newcomers experimenting with generative software for the first time. Each event is packed with ideas, energy, friendly people and amazing projects.  PROCJAM is more than just a jam, though - our mission is to bring generative software communities together, and to make their ideas and technology as accessible and welcoming as possible. We've created free art packs, streamed and archived expert talks, funded tutorials and translated them into multiple languages, and created a zine written by the PROCJAM community. We want to keep growing, supporting our community and welcoming new people into it, and you can help us by funding our Kickstarter for some exciting 2018 projects!

This year we want to try something new, by creating a downloadable example generative project, made in Game Maker, that people can explore, remix and customise. This will give people a great foundation that they can change and personalise and use to start their own adventure with generative software.  To make this happen, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve teamed up with the incredible  Lotte , who is an expert in game development, procedural generation and making beautiful, accessible tools. You can  follow Lotte on Twitter here  and  see some of her amazing work here .       Seeds is our amazing, community-written zine about generative software, which we began in 2016. Our 2016 and 2017 issues are full of dozens and dozens of articles from PROCJAM people about things theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve made, things they love and things theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re thinking about - you can read them online here. This yearÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s funding will pay for editing and design for our new 2018 issue, as well as launching a new website with HTML versions of all the articles for easy linking and sharing!  Game critic, YouTuber and game jam expert  Jupiter Hadley  will be returning as editor and designer for our zine, and will help us put out another beautiful issue full of cool articles! You can learn more about Jupiter  on her site , or  follow her on Twitter here .       PROCJAM doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t rate its entries and it doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t have a winner. Instead, we celebrate everyoneÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s work each year by hiring game jam superstar Jupiter Hadley to come and make a compilation video of every single entry.

Stretch Goals  Our goal represents the minimum we need to keep PROCJAM's traditional activities going, and to make that all-important starter project for newcomers. But we'd like to do a lot more, following on from our success last year.   ÃÂÃÂ£3,500 - Community Tutorials   This stretch goal will fund  four new tutorials written by our community  and hosted on our site.  Last year's tutorials  went really well, and we want to return again this year and get community members to write some tutorials we can host and share with everyone. We'll be going about it a little differently last year, with some specific topics laid out as well as accepting general open pitches.ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ£4,500 - Unity Starter Project   This goal will extend our example project with a Unity version as well, helping people get going with a wider set of tools. Lotte will be working on this one too, so the projects will match up nicely!   ÃÂÃÂ£6000 ÃÂÃÂ -  Tutorials, Translated   Last year we managed to translate our community tutorials into Spanish and Arabic, and with your help we'd like to try and do that again. This stretch goal will help us make that happen!      Risks and challenges  We're always working with people to make sure they can complete their work in a healthy way, without crunching or burning out. That means sometimes our goals slip their deadlines a bit, so we can look after the people who work with us and give their time and expertise. So far, we've never failed to deliver something - but sometimes we can overshoot our estimated dates. Bear with us, and we'll do our best to keep you updated if plans change!"

Risks and challenges  E-Huge Technology Ltd was established since 2011 as a technology base company. We focus on Technology integration and product re-definition. In past years, we have successfully developed various products with Android and Windows platform such as music system, TV box/dongle, educational tablet, smart mirror and AI Translator etc..  Demand drives creation. We noted there are many air cleaners in the market but without sterilization and deodorization functions. Therefore, we are going to develop AirMagic. It is equipped with ""Voltage Electrolysis technology"" to convert safety amount of Ozone. The ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Powerful Convection DesignÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ can diffuse ozone into the air for different room sizes. With strong oxidizing power of ozone, it can decompose fungi, viruses and reduce odor.   Apart from ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Air RefreshingÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ modes mentioned above, AirMagic will also come with ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Clothes handlingÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ modes for Garment deodorization and Clothes drying.   With our strong development background, AirMagicÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s has been developed with CE approval. We are now preparing the material for coming mass production.  To compare with other air cleaners, Airmagic comes with unique 2-in-1 (i.e. both Air Refreshing and Clothes handling) design. We believe there is no similar reference product in the market. It will minimize the risk of challenges"

These boards and accessories will also be delivered - enough to build yourself both the balanced and RCA IO boards.    We need your input   Please drop comments on our campaign and feel free to visit our support/discussion forum. We are really keen to get your ideas on how to make this product more suitable for your needs. We are currently in phase 2 of the design process where we are focusing on connectors.  We have already integrated a large amount of your feedback and suggestions - please keep it coming !  Previous Kickstarter Projects :ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ The audio injector pi sound card :  successful and shipped   The audio injector octo sound card for the Pi :  successful and shipped   The audio injector zero sound card for the Pi :  successful and shipped   The PCB quick connect clip :  successful and shipped       The IO breakout boards are XLR capable. They already have Neutrik footprints ready for you to solder your own XLR connectors onto the PCBs.     Each package contains :  Each pacakge contains the following items;   1x Base sound card  1x Middle balanced preamp board  2x Top IO boards  All of the required connectors to connect the boards together, which include 0.1"" headers, RCA sockets, TRS sockets and plastic spacers for securing the boards   If you pledge for more then one package, you receive all of the above in each pacakge.  You will need to supply your own 40 pin Pi connector.      An older prototype example of the RCA IO board on the top deck. You can produce your own IO boards and PCB templates will be provided.

The ability to plug in your own preamps so you can design your own purpose built preamps and simply plug the base sound card into your products.  Linux driver pre-integrated into the Raspberry Pi Kernel.   Board connections :  The board connections use standard 2.54 mm headers, which are supplied. You will need to solder to connect these to the boards. There are a few 4 pin headers and a few 6 pin headers. There are also the RCA and TRS connectors.  The IO boards also include Neutrik NC3FAH and NC3MAH footprints, so if you prefer to use XLR connectors, you can solder your own on !  If you don't want to use the supplied RCA and TRS connectors, and if you don't want to supply your own Neutrik XLR connectors the why not direct wire out ? DIY wire out from the preamp board to your hardware with full functionality (you can also modify the gain of the input side of the preamp by providing your own resistors in line).  The Pi to Ultra 2 connection requires a standard 40 Pin Pi connector. This is not supplied with the board. You can purchase a quick connect clip which requires no soldering from the ÃÂÃÂ DIY Electronics section of our shop  here . Or you can source a standard header and solder it onto the board.   Noise Floor :  The current version of the sound card has a roughly 100 dB SNR, as shown in the following image. The measurement was taken by directly looping back output to the input. A subsequent listening test confirms the very low noise floor.     SNR of around 100 dB in the current version of the sound card (measured in direct loopback)        Risks and challenges  This is a reasonably low risk project. We have previously had four Kickstarter projects and shipped those products on time. This sound card is already prototyped and tested - we are up to the 16th revision at the launch of this project. Currently the functionality of the sound card has been tested and we are into phase 2 of the design where connectors are being reviewed."

In 2008 I started Windmill Studios in Williamsburg Brooklyn.  While it started out as just me building props and sets, it quickly grew into a full service production studio offering in house production as well as set fabrication.  Over the years I have worked with countless brands, production companies, and marketing agencies to create unique, engaging, and often ridiculously ambitious fabrications.I love what I do, and am extremely excited to have the opportunity to use my skills to bring awareness to a cause that affects so many people.",1.0,2010-08-05 08:15:45 -0400,Backed 1 project,"Brooklyn, NY",KO,"We are building a race car.ÃÂÃÂ  But not just any race car.ÃÂÃÂ  A race car to help spread awareness of Hydrocephalus.ÃÂÃÂ  A condition that affects over 1 million Americans.  My son Dean ""The Machine"" was born with Hydrocephalus.ÃÂÃÂ  He underwent 3 brain surgeries by the time he was 9 months old.ÃÂÃÂ  Through the amazing work of our neurosurgeon, Dean's condition was treated, and he has grown into a very happy, energetic, and handsome 3 year old.  Dean loves race cars! Thank you Pixar.ÃÂÃÂ  We love race cars too.ÃÂÃÂ  So we thought, why not build Dean a race car, and we'll use it raise awareness about the condition, and also bring smiles to the faces of other kids affected by it.  Our plan for the car has many layers to it.ÃÂÃÂ  When we decided to build the car, we figured it had to be an endurance racer.ÃÂÃÂ  Hydrocephalus patients endure a life time of battling the condition, and endurance racing is the perfect racing to embody that struggle.ÃÂÃÂ  It also gives us the opportunity to reach people for a much longer event than just a night at the drag strip.ÃÂÃÂ  We will be competing in several endurance races over the first season, and will then take things from there.  We are also planning to bring the car to Hydrocephalus events all over region and possibly the country!ÃÂÃÂ  We are planning to take the car to Hydrocephalus walks, picnics, and gatherings, as well as hopefully making hospital visits to kids who have undergone recent surgeries so they can sit in the car and meet the drivers.  We are asking you to help some crazy people who are willing to subject themselves to the perils of endurance racing, to do so for a great cause and put some smiles on some faces!ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  Building and running a race car comes with constant challenges.  You are essentially pulling everything out of a car, modifying the engine and transmission to make it go as fast as possible, then installing all the equipment necessary to not kill yourself while driving it.  The main challenge and cost comes in the driver driver safety systems.   Roll cage, onboard fire suppression systems, racing seat, electrical systems, on board driver cooling, helmets, fireproof racing suits, Head And Neck (HAN) systems, the list goes on.    The main risk in endurance racing is obviously that you die in a giant fireball.  The lesser risks are banged up knuckles, pinched fingers, frustrating late nights, and race track repairs.  Why are we equipped to overcome theses challenges?  Our team is comprised of the set fabrication and production team at Windmill Studios.    We have a lot of experience doing things we have no experience doing.  We build custom sets, props, and special effects for the film and television industry.  We have a full shop and a team of skilled engineers, fabricators, welders, and craftspeople.  We believe all of these specialty skills will allow us to persevere even in the face of great trail.    We are also, just crazy enough to believe this can work."

Working with people around the world, Public Lab has developed an affordable way to peek into this hidden world.        Using simple materials, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve developed a kit you can build yourself - the result of many teamsÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> work coming together! Introducing the  Community Microscope :       It takes only fifteen minutes to build, and plugs into a smartphone or laptop. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a simple but elegant design -- you focus it by tightening the bolts, and the basic version is made from a webcam with its lens flipped upside down.   Public Lab is an open community  of activists, tinkerers, organizers, makers, educators and scientists around the world, who have worked together to design this kit. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve worked with a growing coalition to take  a Do-It-Yourself approach to environmental justice issues .   We welcome you to join in making these techniques more accessible!       The Community Microscope Kit WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re offering a range of options with mix-and-match components -- start with the intro kit and we'll be offering upgrade kits after the campaign. ÃÂÃÂ   The Intro Kit   This kit is very simple: a webcam, a platform of corrugated plastic, a set of nuts, bolts &amp; rubber bands, and some double-sided adhesive strips! With it, you can easily see objects as small as 5 microns (a micron is 1/1000 of 1 millimeter), such as plant cells and the single-celled organisms that swim around in pond water and puddles. This kit is great for people who want to get started quickly and experiment with the way their microscope is put together.               Lens Upgrades  We also have more advanced models for people who want to look at different things, take higher-quality photographs, and use stronger magnification lenses.   Everything is designed to fit together, so if you start with the basic kit, thereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a clear upgrade path to better components later. But using a microscopic ruler, we found that even with the webcam version, you can see things as small as 5 microns wide -- 8x smaller than a human hair!       Microscope Plus &amp; Super Microscope Kits  The next step up (the  Plus Kit )  includes an adapter to a 20x microscope objective lens -- enabling you to see much smaller objects with better optics. Because of the modular construction of our kit, you can simply swap in the lens and raise the platform to accommodate it. Our  Super Microscope Kit  will include a 40x lens.        See how the parts fit together in a modular system; the larger lenses replace the flipped webcam lens shown here, and all cameras and lenses are interchangeable:       Camera Upgrades  For use with higher quality lenses, we also offer kits with upgraded cameras -- the Raspberry Pi camera.See how the parts fit together in a modular system; the larger lenses replace the flipped webcam lens shown here, and all cameras and lenses are interchangeable        Pi Camera Microscope Kit  The Pi Camera kit includes a much higher resolution Raspberry Pi camera (v1.3) -- at 5 megapixels. In this prototype we were testing rubber bands, but the final will feature springs along with its laser-cut acrylic platforms:       Additional higher-end versions like our  Super  and  Deluxe Pi Camera Microscope Kits  include up to 100x microscope lenses! And our  Classroom Kit  includes materials for a whole class of students to make five microscopes.ÃÂÃÂ      2 micron sized particles through a Raspberry Pi microscope    How did we get here?  Not only does this kit build on the work of open source science groups like  Parts &amp; Crafts ,  Hackteria ,  Lifepatch  and the  Open Flexure Microscope  project, but because of Public Lab's mission to address environmental problems that affect people, we also worked with communities who are facing  air pollution which they hope to photograph with these kits .        Public Lab has been working with people across Wisconsin whoÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen pollution from a boom in frac sand mining -- mining vast amounts of sand to use in oil and gas frac operations in other states. The especially worrisome part is a form of air pollution calledÃÂÃÂ  respirable silica -- a fine, sharp-edged crystalline dust which can cause respiratory problems  -- blowing over and into peoples homes and yards.         Although many efforts to document pollution use expensive air samplers, lab tests and equipment, people living around the mines can see dust piling up on their windowsills and in their homes.   Some community members sought a way to actually see these particles as small as 2.5 microns in size - an idea which led to the Community Microscope project. These photos could be used in advocacy and to raise awareness, but may also be helpful to see what particles are made of, just by examining them visually.     High quality image taken using 100x lens and Raspberry Pi camera    Why we need you  Now we need you to take the next step. Community efforts like these only work if we build a broad, inclusive community of practice.   That means we need activists, educators, hobbyists, and professional scientists to join in, and work together. We need illustrators and writers to present these ideas clearly. Engineers and tinkerers to refine the open source kits!ÃÂÃÂ We need all kinds of skills and backgrounds, so this means you!  How can you get involved? We're building a list of challenges and goals, and need your help to:   try it out -- look at many different things!ÃÂÃÂ   troubleshoot and refine its assemblyimprove the lighting systemÃÂÃÂ   identify and address rough spots in the designÃÂÃÂ   produce documentation and even curriculumÃÂÃÂ   teach workshops and host community events  and much more to come!    Sign up for a kit today and help bring this project to life.   A Do-It-Yourself approach  Public Lab, the open source community which launched the DIY spectrometer, the Balloon Mapping Kit, and the Infragram camera, has been working with community groups around the world who need affordable microscopes to photograph air pollutants, measure ocean microplastics, and identify other kinds of microscopic environmental problems.   Luckily, many open source groups around the world -- like Hackteria and the OpenFlexure Microscope team, as well as folks in the Public Lab network -- have been working for years to make scientific research accessible to anyone who wants to participate.        Building an alliance  How did these people all work together to get this far? Public Lab follows a coalition building model, where we connect people from around the world to cooperate on shared problems, like measuring air and water pollution. When communities facing pollution can team up with a larger community of makers, educators, and organizers, they can call in help, lead problem definition, and ensure that work is focused on a real-world problem.       8 years of Public Lab  We've worked with communities around the world for eight years -- since the BP oil disaster, and we've run several Kickstarters to distribute affordable science tools to people who need them.ÃÂÃÂ         Risks and challenges  NOT ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>JUST A STOREÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ  Distributing kits as we do, itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s always a risk that people will think of us as an online business, and not a growing community (and a non-profit) where their involvement is more important than the money they spend. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re doing our best to communicate what weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re about through the story above, but weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re also dedicated to shaping the objects themselves, their boxes and packaging, to communicate this ethos. That said, we've run five successful Kickstarters in this way, and have been distributing tens of thousands of kits around the world for eight years -- so it's not new to us!  TACKLING CHALLENGES TOGETHER   Part of the challenge of Public Lab work in general is to encourage people to share and build things together -- not just things theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve done, but questions they want to ask, concerns they have, and requests for help. Sometimes it can feel like these are impositions on everyone else, but at Public Lab we celebrate them as the very foundation of the collaborative process. Sharing half-completed projects, doubts, and frustrations can help invite others into your work and strengthen it.   Of course, it can also be a challenge to encourage people to report back when they do projects. These projects are about more than ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>toolsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ -- theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re about the stories that come from people adapting, reshaping, and applying them to a thousand different problems or scenarios. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be highlighting many of the stories of peopleÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s amazing work with balloon mapping kits   Finally, these essentials -- engagement in collective brainstorming, troubleshooting, and sharing -- are even more important with the Prototyping Kits we're introducing. These kits have a range of issues and unknowns to tackle, and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re counting on you all to get involved and put them through their paces."

It saves you money and lets you enjoy clean, pesticide-free plants - itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s also fun and therapeutic.ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ However, growing at home is an intimidating endeavor for the uninitiated. ThereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a lack of trustworthy education out there for new growers, and most growers just learn the ropes through their friends and acquaintances (and years of trial and error).  ÃÂÃÂ   But times have changed. Cultural attitudes are shifting, sustainability is king, and home growing isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t just for the inner circle anymore ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> home growing is for EVERYBODY! ÃÂÃÂ   The problem is, not everybody can dedicate a whole room or closet to be an indoor garden. And not everybody wants an unattractive mess of buckets, wires, and strange devicesÃÂÃÂ  in their home. And NOBODY has unlimited free time to tend to their plants, build daunting DIY systems, or troubleshoot environment problems.ÃÂÃÂ   ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why we created GYO: an all-in-one system designed for a new generation of growers.                 ÃÂÃÂ Just like the sun outdoors, the grow light is the heartbeat - the single most important element - in any indoor garden.  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   GYO is powered by a BloomBoss TrueSun LED, an ultra-premium LED grow light thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s already a favorite among home growers. Highly efficient LED technology keeps electricity costs low.  Electricity savings arenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t the only benefit ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> the TrueSun spectrum has been time-tested to provide the perfect balance of blue, red, and full-spectrum white light to make plants thrive.  ÃÂÃÂ        Unlike most LED grow lights, GYOÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s grow light gives off UV-A. UV-A gently stresses plants so that they kick resin production into overdrive, and then push as much of that resin as possible to the surface of the buds to protect them ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> which means a stickier, more potent harvest.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Our growers have done side-by-side grow comparisons with and without UV-A, and the flowers grown under UV-A are noticeably ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>frostierÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ and more colorful.ÃÂÃÂ             GYO grows with an easy-to-use deep water culture (DWC) hydroponics system. Plants' roots grow directly into a water and nutrient solution, and oxygen is provided by an air stone. DWC allows maximum uptake of oxygen and nutrients for vigorous growth, with no need for a dosing system or a watering can. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Growing hydroponically has numerous advantages over growing in soil. Plants grow faster, and flowers and fruits grow bigger and have a cleaner taste and smell.  ÃÂÃÂ   Watering plants by hand is time consuming, and is also where many new growers make mistakes by over- or under-watering their plants. GYOÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s hydroponics system is foolproof, and all you need to do is change the water and nutrients once per week.ÃÂÃÂ        Anyone whoÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s recently started an indoor garden can tell you that environment control is one of the hardest parts of growing, especially for finicky plants. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s always too hot, too cold, too dry, too humid ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> and a setup that works during one season becomes totally out of whack once the weather changes.  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   GYO's environment is self-contained and regulated by sensor-based micro -controllers, so no matter the climate, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll always have the perfect conditions for your crops to thrive.       Some of our favorite plants are like dogs and babies ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> we love them and care for them, even though they can be smelly!  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   GYO has a built-in carbon filtration system to dissipate any strong, distinct odors, keeping your indoor garden discreet.ÃÂÃÂ        GYO masquerades as a sleek mini-refrigerator, and has a secure locking system to protect your plants. Let GYO blend in discreetly among your appliances, or open it up and show off your garden ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s up to you!ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ Your indoor garden can be up and running in no time, right out of the box. GYO plugs in to a standard 120V outlet. Once GYO is powered up, simply fill the water reservoir, add nutrients, plant your seed or clone, and start growing!ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ GYO is designed to make it as easy as possible for growers to have successful harvests, regardless of experience. However, as plants are living things, sometimes adjustments might need to be made. We will offer a whole year of free horticultural support with the purchase of each GYO, provided by the home grow experts here at BloomBoss.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ                  BloomBoss was founded in 2010 on the belief that as technology evolves, so should growing methods.

ÃÂÃÂ   MagneTag is an advanced system of wearable magnetic field sensors.ÃÂÃÂ They are designed to electronically detect the foamy blows of justice you rain down on your (fr)enemies using our arsenal of magnetically enhanced foam swords,ÃÂÃÂ ninja stars, and blaster darts.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ                Our core demographics are kids and drunk people.    HOW DOES IT WORK?ÃÂÃÂ   Magnets dude, magnets.ÃÂÃÂ  I personally hold two degrees in physics and I still don't fully understand their magical powers.ÃÂÃÂ  We employ a phenomenon known as electromagnetic induction: when a magnet moves near a conductor, it makes the electrons want to move around too.ÃÂÃÂ  We can measure that!ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ           Our user testing shows that less than 7% of small children cry while playing MagneTag.    FUN.

This campaign has been vetted by 3rd party engineers to ensure our meticulous planning is on target.ÃÂÃÂ  We won't let you down!ÃÂÃÂ        This sensor is designed to be made without expensive tooling which can often cause production timelines to slip. Its basically just a 6""x6"" circuit board with rubber edge trim, a couple of screws, strap webbing, and plastic buckles.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ Instead of working with a foreign manufacturer, we will source from the USA and assemble everything in-house.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ           Your trusty partner in the battles to come. This is not for the kiddies, ages 13 and up.            ""GET TO DA CHOPPA!"" you yell as you slam in another magazine of magnetic darts.              Literally anything can be magnetized and be compatible with our system.ÃÂÃÂ  We love pool noodles because they are the safest and cheapest. Gloves or socks are also easy to magnetize.ÃÂÃÂ  I'm not suggesting you go all Walker Texas Ranger on anyone, but you could.ÃÂÃÂ  Note: the bigger the magnet, the longer the effective range of the tagger.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ      You can shove magnets into the tips of standard blaster darts.

Its a lot of work but not a big enough job to take advantage of mass production.  This is not the first rodeo for team MagneTag.  If you search this site you will find our first unsuccessful Kickstarter.  Even though we didn't raise enough money, in the following year we shipped over 200 units of that initial design.  The people that bought them were very happy, but we decided to change the product because there was too much labor involved, which means we had to sell them at a price most people couldn't afford.  We think we have solved this problem with the newest iteration.    This project has greatly reduced risks.  Taking a page from the IKEA manual: It is dead simple to put together.  We will likely end up having to assemble these units with a small team, so it is designed accordingly.    Finally we have been participating in the Hardware Studio Connection program ( https://hardware.studio/connection ) which has partnered us with professional design engineers to review our production plans and costs to make sure we can deliver our rewards on time and on budget.  You can have confidence when you back this project that we will get you your MagneTag!"

I decided to upgrade to the stars and worked as a consultant for NASA within the Ares1 (follow-on to the Shuttle) assessing and solving problems of risk and vulnerability to insure mission and crew survivability and success.  (Unfortunately, I never made if off planet earth.)So, anticipating early on that I wouldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t be able to leave earth (or the universe) physically, I took the non-physical approach by researching altered states of consciousness with Bob Monroe (Journeys Out of the Body, Far Journeys and Ultimate Journey) in the early 70s.

As drug-free pioneers in the field of consciousness research we experimentally developed a technology for creating very stable and productive altered states of consciousness within subjects who had no meditation experience.Over the last 45 years, I have created and maintained a very successful career in applied physics, as well as a parallel career in consciousness research exploring the frontiers of reality, mind, consciousness and psychic phenomena.  In February of 2003, I published the My Big TOE (Theory of Everything) trilogy representing the results and conclusions of my scientific exploration of the nature of existence.Now IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m travelling extensively and lecturing internationally on the My Big TOE (MBT) virtual reality model.  In June of 2017, I co-authored the peer-reviewed physics paper in the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Journal of Quantum FundamentalsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ entitled: ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>On Testing the Simulation Theory.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ These physics experiments have the potential to verify and support MBT theory.  They will, if they work as I predict, significantly erode confidence in traditional scienceÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s belief in materialism.  Gathering the resources to get these experiments done is what this Kickstarter campaign is all about.When you have some time (but stay on Kickstarter for now) you can check-out my website, www.my-big-toe.com  and YouTube channel, www.youtube.com/twcjr44.  The cornerstone on my teaching and personal philosophy is: ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Always be open-minded and always be skeptical ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> especially of your own ideas.  ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	If it is not your experience, it cannot be your truth.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	Learn to live gracefully with uncertainty.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0098>Becoming loveÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> describes the purpose, the process, and the meaning of your existence.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂIf youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re reading and understanding this, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re headed for a great experienceÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t stop now.  Be a part of history. These experiments could change everything we think we know about science, and initiate the largest paradigm shift the world has ever experienced -- moving us toward a more caring, kinder, and sustainable future.

We're interested in your feedback--pro or con, bring it on!    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WuNxIkA5jn7HLUFhhLqBGzCekf3h91Nv/view         Can the theory that physical reality is a simulation (i.e., Virtual Reality) be tested through scientific experimentation?ÃÂÃÂ     Tom Campbell and his team of scientists believe it can.ÃÂÃÂ     You can be a Part of History and help us find out.ÃÂÃÂ     And this is real 21st Century science:ÃÂÃÂ          So let us explain: ÃÂÃÂ   The proposed experiments are described in our paper,   On Testing the Simulation Theory  , which has been  peer-reviewed and published  in the   International Journal of Quantum Foundations  :             The analogy between physical reality and video games (Virtual Reality) can be helpful in explaining our experimental approach to the question.   Using the  video game  analogy, we propose an investigation based on the assumptions:ÃÂÃÂ     1.	  The system performing the simulation (in either physical reality or virtual reality) is finite (i.e., has limited information processing resources no matter how great those resources may be).  All video games  have finite resources and currently accepted Quantum Theory supports the finite nature of physical reality;ÃÂÃÂ    2. 	To achieve low computational complexity (due to finite resources) such a system would,  as in a video game  system, render the content only when (at that moment) the required information becomes available to the player;ÃÂÃÂ    3. 	 In a video game , the (game box) processor cannot be part of the virtual reality it is creating. It follows that if physical reality is a simulation, the computations required to create the physical reality cannot be determined by mechanisms that are part of the physical reality created.ÃÂÃÂ    Guided by these assumptions, the proposed experiments describe variations of the universally accepted wave/particle duality experimentÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>which when successfully performedÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>will test whether our currently accepted concept of physical reality will respond as if it were a simulation  (Virtual Reality) .ÃÂÃÂ    If reality does respond to these experiments as only a simulation (Virtual Reality) could, and if there is no other hypothesis which can explain the experimental results, then the logical conclusion is that our reality is, in fact, a simulation. ÃÂÃÂ        HereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a schematic diagram to help you understand our goals.ÃÂÃÂ  Also, Check-out Goal #2 description (below). ÃÂÃÂ  When we say ""more videos"" we mean  ""more experiments and videos.""               Raise a minimum of $150,000 to perform one (or more) of the experiments and produce a video documentary about it.    As soon as we reach the initial $150,000,  weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be able to buy the equipment, rent suitable lab space and perform one or more of the experiments. Once the equipment is set-up it wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t be difficult to perform multiple experiments testing the Simulation Hypotheses in different ways. As part of the set-up and testing, we plan to record the process and produce a video documenting the entire process.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ     And there's more...    As some of you may know, Tom has designed a  comprehensive number of experiments  that will be able to address additional questions that may come-up as we proceed.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ              Beyond the Initial ExperimentsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦ÃÂÃÂ    If we can raise additional funds (beyondÃÂÃÂ   Goal #1)ÃÂÃÂ   we plan to produce  additional experiments, documentaries and videos  addressing relevant issues dealing with your life in a Virtual Reality.  For each additional $150,000 we raise , we will produce  additional experiments and documentaries  along with more of the following videos (and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>d love to hear your ideas about the order youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>d like to see them produced).   Let's go beyond Goal #1  and do  all  the experiments and document the experimental process--as well as better explain the  implications for your life ÃÂÃÂ and the and MBT concepts involved.        1.  How Does Virtual Reality Work?  ÃÂÃÂ   Discuss the logical implications, the mechanics, the science, connection to the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>physicalÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ world, connection between mind and matter.ÃÂÃÂ    2.  Virtual Reality ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> Solving Paradoxes  ÃÂÃÂ   Solving the fundamental scientific and philosophical paradoxes created by the current reality model.ÃÂÃÂ    3.  What Living in a Virtual Reality Means to You  ÃÂÃÂ   Who, what and why do we exist? Why should I care? What does living in a Virtual Reality have to do with my everyday life?ÃÂÃÂ    4.  The Larger Consciousness System (LCS)  ÃÂÃÂ   What is the LCS and where does it come from? How did our Virtual Reality come to exist? What is its purpose?ÃÂÃÂ    5.  Life, Death and the Immortal Nature of ConsciousnessÃÂÃÂ     The nature of sequential lives and their purpose.ÃÂÃÂ    6.  The Constraints and Freedoms of Virtual RealityÃÂÃÂ     What are some of the abilities and restrictions that Virtual Reality implies?ÃÂÃÂ    7.  How to Find Meaning, Happiness,     and Joy in the Virtual LifeÃÂÃÂ     How do you optimize the Virtual Life?ÃÂÃÂ    8.  The Evolution of ConsciousnessÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>Our Eventual Future and How We May Get ThereÃÂÃÂ     How to save the world and ourselves at the same time.ÃÂÃÂ    9.  Life as a Citizen of the Larger RealityÃÂÃÂ     Responsibility to yourself and others.ÃÂÃÂ    10.  And finally, If we hit a Grand-Slam weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll invest the extra funds in developing a comprehensive, easy to understand, series of videos on the science behind TomÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s Theory of Everything (ToE)ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦ÃÂÃÂ     Educational programs like this will become a part of TomÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s new   Center for the Unification of Science and Consciousness   (in-formation).              Why All the Rewards? IsnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t the Knowledge Enough?  ÃÂÃÂ   We all know how valuable having this information for ourselves will beÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>it will change our lives.ÃÂÃÂ   But we canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t stop there. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s also important to spread the knowledge around and get others talking.ÃÂÃÂ   The Rewards can help do that. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s not just a coffee mug or a T-shirtÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>it carries a message.ÃÂÃÂ All the Reward items carry messages.ÃÂÃÂ   The Rewards can stimulate discussion with your friends and family. They can encourage some independent (personal) research by someone who notices.ÃÂÃÂ   You can even re-gift them!ÃÂÃÂ   Our Kickstarter campaign only lasts for 30 days, but the inspiration lasts forever.ÃÂÃÂ     Note:   Some of our backers have attempted to select multiple Reward tiersÃÂÃÂ but been unable.ÃÂÃÂ  Unfortunately, this is a Kickstarter rule.ÃÂÃÂ  It's our mistake (ugh!).ÃÂÃÂ  This is our first Kickstarter and we weren't aware of that rule.ÃÂÃÂ  It's a bigger problem when a backer selects a ""Stand-Alone"" Reward which doesn't include any other reward tiers.ÃÂÃÂ  We designed the ""Stand-Alone"" Rewards with the assumption you would be able to select additional tiers.ÃÂÃÂ  If you're one of those backers, please let us know of the problem and we'll find a way to get you the Rewards you want.ÃÂÃÂ  We'll also be consulting with Kickstarter seeking a solution.    Note:ÃÂÃÂ    You may wonder why some of the Rewards shipping dates listed are so far out.ÃÂÃÂ  Until we close the Kickstarter campaign we won't know how many videos we'll be producingÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>and it takes time to produce quality videos.  If you're due a series of Rewards, we'll be shipping those shorter lead-time items as soon as they're ready.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Earn a lot of Rewards and you'll be getting goodies periodically for the next year!         1. Why are you doing this instead of a larger, more prestigious organization?ÃÂÃÂ     WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re not so shabby when you look at our individual credentials. Thomas Campbell, a former NASA physicist, and pioneer in the study of consciousness leads a team of Ph.D. scientists from some of the most prestigious governmental and academic institutions in America. Our team published a peer-reviewed (i.e., reviewed by other scientists) paper describing our quantum physics experiments in June 2016 in the ÃÂÃÂ Journal of Quantum Foundations .ÃÂÃÂ   ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a lot of work to produce a paper like this. It also means that our scientific peers reviewed our work and determined our paper was worthy of publication in a prestigious journal. Few scientific papers submitted to journals are published.ÃÂÃÂ     2. Why hasnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t this experiment been done before?ÃÂÃÂ     ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s not easy to make it this far when you're addressing a topic that suggests a profound change in the currently accepted model of reality. Scientists like Tom Campbell have been quietly working for years, developing the solid theoretical foundation for these types of experiments. ThereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a tremendous resistance to this type of radical change in thinking within the scientific establishments. It has the potential to upset a lot of scientific apple carts.ÃÂÃÂ     3. Why now? Why this moment?ÃÂÃÂ     We think the moment is ripe to address this question. Thought provoking content dealing with the nature of information-based virtual reality is starting to permeate the media and entertainment industries. At the same time, ground-breaking information-processing technology is accelerating exponentiallyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>raising additional questions and providing increasingly precise experimental equipment. Now is the time.ÃÂÃÂ     4. What are the implications for my lifeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>for all of us?ÃÂÃÂ     The implications for humanity, that we may be living in a simulation, are profound. This evolution in consciousness may change the relationship we have with the universeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>and even with each other. As our self-awareness grows, so will our relationship with the world. Rather than individual islands of ego, we will become a part of a much larger and interconnected system of creation and cooperation. Our time (today) will prove to be a seminal inflection point in the evolution of humanity.ÃÂÃÂ     5. HasnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t someone else already addressed this?ÃÂÃÂ     Science has been reluctant to test this theory since it is radically contrary to current orthodoxy. However, we now have more sophisticated tools for measurement than ever before, and a group of scientists willing to put their reputations on the line to advance humanityÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s understanding of itself.ÃÂÃÂ   And, of course, there was never a Kickstarter platform to raise the funding outside of the established institutions.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ   For the last 30 minutes, from 7:30-8pm E | 4:30-5pm P, former NASA physicist, and pioneering consciousness researcher TOM CAMPBELL will be stopping by THE Q. to catch Jill &amp; her listeners up on his exciting series of 17 quantum mechanics experiments which might show us once and for all that we are living in a virtual reality.

Just like Steve Jobs said,  who needs a stylus for smart phones, after we have 10 fingers?ÃÂÃÂ  Who needs dimmers for dimming, after we have light switches everywhere?  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ The mission of Cello Lighting is to set free dimming by allowing users to dim their lights effortlessly with existing light switches.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ The secret of such innovation is a tiny smart chip, Waltz, which can be integrated into every single light fixture.ÃÂÃÂ      Waltz dimming chip       WZ1801 Dimming Intelligence Module       Wiring Diagram of Waltz Module    Waltz is a proprietary smart chip. It turns an ordinary light fixture into an intelligent genie.ÃÂÃÂ  With Waltz, users can dim any lights from 100% to 0% with existing light switches.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  No need of wall dimmers or wiring over the ceiling, or any wireless gadgets.ÃÂÃÂ  It just takes a Waltz dance step, one-two-three, then the job is done.         You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.      Play                                      Replay with sound          Play with   sound                   00:00    00:00                                           Case Study 2: Waltz Dimming Downlight     Waltz Adds No Extra Cost   ÃÂÃÂ Waltz is the first affordable AI solution for commercial/industrial lighting system.ÃÂÃÂ  Not only because the chip is tiny and intelligent, but also because there is no extra labor other than replacing a light fixture or light bulb.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  The installation of Waltz dimming solution is extremely easy.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ As shown in the following diagram, all you have to do is replacing the old fixture with new LED Waltz light fixtures.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ That is it.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ The existing power lines instantly become dimming control wires.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ No matter it is UFO lamp, Linear Troffer, Linear Fixture, or any other light fixtures, all Waltz lights can be dimmed by existing light switches. The Waltz chip inside the light fixture deciphers the way you turn on/off the light and responds with dimming or any kinds of control, such as turning on/off the light sensors/motion sensors, setting up the delay time of occupancy sensors, etc.     Waltz Dimming without Autumn Control Gateway    The users would feel no pains for the change. They can turn on/off or dim their lights with the same zonal information they had. No wiring, wireless pairing or IP configuration is needed to keep those zonal information. For instance, the lights in conference rooms are still controlled by the switches in conference rooms.  The lights in break rooms are still controlled by the switches in break rooms.  Such valuable zonal information could have cost a big fortune of labor for wireless or wired dimming solutions to configure.  But for Waltz dimming, it is a gimme and takes no cost.     Zero Extra Cost for Waltz Dimming Solution     Waltz Solves the Dimming Compatibility Nightmare   ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  Traditionally, the pairing between dimmers and lights was an ongoing nightmare.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  If dimmers are not compatible with the lights, the lights would flicker like crazy.ÃÂÃÂ  The dimming range might be cut down to only 1/2 or 1/3.ÃÂÃÂ  No electricians can guarantee the dimmers would work with the new lights until they install them.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ Statistically, there are hundreds of LED drivers with different electrical parameters.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ To make them all work with one single dimmer, is definitely a huge challenge.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ With Waltz, the problem is solved.ÃÂÃÂ  Because each dimmer (the Waltz chip) is integrated into one light fixtures.ÃÂÃÂ  The intelligent Waltz dimmer would adapt and customize the electrical parameters for the companion light to make sure it works perfectly.ÃÂÃÂ  Each Waltz light is a complete dimmer-light duo.ÃÂÃÂ  Before a Waltz light is shipped, the manufacturers already tested the dimming behavior, making sure they are smooth and no glitches and the dimming range is healthy.ÃÂÃÂ  Therefore when a Waltz light is shipped to customers, it is guaranteed to work smoothly with no surprise.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  In other words, the light switch is only used to  trigger  the dimming process.ÃÂÃÂ  But the complicated  dimming ÃÂÃÂ behavior is implemented by the smart Waltz dimmer inside each light fixture.ÃÂÃÂ  Since the pairing between a Waltz chip and a light is resolved in factories, any kinds of electrical compatibility issues could be resolved and verified before the products are shipped out to customers.     Waltz Lamps displayed in LFI 2018 at Chicago     Waltz can be Easily Upgraded for Network Lighting Control   In order to enable the network control of the lighting system, Cello Lighting also created an intelligent solution: Autumn Control Gateway (ACG).ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ACG is a multiple function smart gateway.ÃÂÃÂ  It is a Internet Router equipped with built-in  breaker  and  smart power meter .ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   As shown in the followingÃÂÃÂ diagram, when an ACG is installed in an area, it works with a smart phone App to either turn on/offÃÂÃÂ  or dim the lights in the area.ÃÂÃÂ  ACG could also allow users to schedule a time-base event to turn on/off or dim the lights in this area.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ      Waltz Dimming with Autumn Control Gateway    On the other hand, ACG also  meters the energy usage  of the lights in this area and passes the data to the Cello Cloud.  With Cello Cloud, users can browse and download the energy usage reports daily, weekly or quarterly. Other than energy reports, the recorded electrical data would also enable Cello Cloud to help facility managers to do the diagnosis and maintenance of their lighting system.ÃÂÃÂ  For instance, if some light fixture is out, the reduction of power usage would allow Cello Cloud to alert the maintenance team to resolve the issue proactively.   Waltz All Lights   With collaboration with more than 30 LED lighting contracted manufacturers, Cello Lighting is planning to launch more than 10 lines of lighting products, including ACG and nine kinds of light fixtures.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ These lighting products altogether can cover more than 80% of the indoor commercial / industrial lighting applications.                                Please support and back our campaign to set free the dimming of all lights around us.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ With your support, we can together save more energy in public space, protect kids' eyes in classrooms, ease up patients' moods in hospitals, grow plants efficientlyÃÂÃÂ in greenhouse.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Let's work together to release the power of dimming.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ     Title-24 Solutions: ÃÂÃÂ  Waltz Demo Kit (LOSA) ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ In order to help promote Waltz Lamps, Cello Lighting also provides a complete demo kit called LOSA, which stands for Light-sensing, Occupancy-control, Smart-meter and Auto-demand-response dimming.            LOSA includes one Waltz 2' 30W Linear Light and one Autumn Control Gateway (ACG) and one motion/light sensor. With the power line plugged in, it is ready to go. You could just turn on and off the light switch in LOSA to demonstrate Waltz dimming. You could also show daylight harvesting or occupancy control with LOSA.ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ On top of Waltz dimming, you could also demonstrate energy metering and remote lighting control using your smart phones. First of all, please download a free App. With the App, you are able to meter the energy usage of the light inside the LOSA, as shown in the following diagram.       ÃÂÃÂ You could use the App to turn on/off or dim the light inside LOSA. The energy usage data is stored in Cello Cloud and could be retrieved by smart phones or PCs to generate energy usage reports. With LOSA, it is demonstrated that Waltz can fulfill Title-24 requirements, that is:ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ 1) Daylight harvestingÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ 2) Occupancy controlÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ 3) Central control &amp; meteringÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ 4) Continuous dimmingÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ 5) ADR (Auto-Demand-Response) dimming capabilities      Risks and challenges  While Waltz Dimmer and Autumn Control Gateway are still under development, we are very comfortable with the functionality and the design. We paid a particular attention to select only multi-source components to guarantee durability and supplying. We choose our partners based on their track records in lighting industry in the USA market.  Thanks to their solid experiences in the U.S. market project industrialization, we worked to minimize risk in all aspects of the project. We calculated our delivery date based on their estimations.  We are near to refine our design and move into manufacturing but as with any hardware project, challenges may arise. Unexpected delays related to factory line set up or production could occur. The certification path can also lead to design changes requiring some additional iterations. This being said, be sure we will put all our energy and passion to deliver the product in which we trust."

To support New Zealand's journey at the forefront of clean and green technology with the development of cutting edge electric vehicles  To show New Zealand just how amazing electric vehicles can be, and that we can make them right here at home:         Our adventure started in 2014 when Sytse Tacoma created MotoSync NZ and began construction of the first electric bike, the RS-E50.  Fully road registered, the bike has completed almost 6000km of road use - there are no oils, no coolants and no fossil fuels; just charge and ride. ÃÂÃÂ   THE UPGRADE   In 2017 we decided it was time to take our technology further - we started a new company, Tacoma Liddell (TL), and began work on a more advanced battery pack.  The new high-performance system uses the same type of battery cell technology in the Tesla production cars, namely 18650 cells:      A section of the TL battery (shown here with Sytse)    Our targets with the upgrade:ÃÂÃÂ    Increase bike range from 100km to  180km     Reduce acceleration time (0-100km/h) from 3.8s to  3.4/3.5 s  ÃÂÃÂ   Reduce charge time from 3 hours to  20 mins  (DC fast charger) ÃÂÃÂ    When buying in bulk, each of these cells cost us $5.50, and we will need over a  thousand  of them!ÃÂÃÂ   Every backer can have their  name written on a cell  and a picture sent to them - we will send you a direct message asking for your name. The cells will then go into the motorbike, making every one of our backers part of our record attempt.  THE PLAN FOR 2018/2019   Complete design work for our new battery -  Done !

Alternatively, the intervalometer capability can capture a time-lapse sequence over a period of hours.ÃÂÃÂ The flexible design allows the use of multiple sensors to generate a trigger signal.ÃÂÃÂ The system has a massive extensibility through a well-engineered sensor/actuator module interface and will be expanded even more through software updates.  The photographerÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s interface with Camera Axe 6 is sophisticated but simple.  YouÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve probably noticed there is no screen on the Camera Axe 6.  Instead the Camera Axe 6 uses wireless communications to connect to your smartphone as a website accessed through a web browser.  You simply open the Camera Axe 6 webpage and start inputting the settings.  For example, you could input that you want your camera to trigger with a slight delay when a loud noise is made.  Modules  Modules are the ears, eyes, and arms of the Camera Axe 6. To date, there are seven different modules that have been developed to solve almost any high-speed photography problem.  Some of them are sensory, while others control the environment. To illustrate, if you need to detect a balloon popping, plug in the sound module, or if you need to detect lightning, plug in the light module.  The Camera Axe 6 interacts with the surrounding environment through a variety of modules. The four module ports on the Camera Axe 6 can accept sensor modules that are  able to detect something in the physical world such as a speeding bullet. Alternatively, a module can be an actuator to control external devices.  An actuator module controlling water droplets is likely to be one of the most popular modules for the Camera Axe 6.  Each module port connects through a RJ45 jack. Because this is the same type of jack as Ethernet uses, cables are available in a variety of lengths and compositions.  Each module port supplies 3.3VDC and ground to any attached module.  The remaining six wires in the cable provide  an analog input pin and five more digital pins that provide slightly different functionality depending on which of the four ports is being used. This provides maximum flexibility for the diverse  types of hardware with which it can interface.  The different module ports support I2C, Serial, SPI, or more analog pins.  Below is a list of the different modules.      Taken with the Beam Module      The Beam Module ÃÂÃÂ has an emitter and detector. To take the picture above the emitter and detector were just placed about three feet apart.ÃÂÃÂ  When the bird flew between them a photo was taken.ÃÂÃÂ  Here's a video with detailed information about the  Beam Module .ÃÂÃÂ       Taken with the Light Module      The Light Module ÃÂÃÂ is the expert sensor at detecting lightning.ÃÂÃÂ  The picture above shows how even when there is ambient light it can still capture the shots you want. The Light Module also comes with a laser pointer, so it can be used to create laser triggers.  Here's an informational video about the  Light Module .      Taken with the Projectile Module      The Projectile Module ÃÂÃÂ is used for photographing moving objects like bullets in flight. It records the speed of a bullet and then controls a camera shutter or flash to let you position the bullet exactly where you want in the photograph.  For example, maybe you want to capture a bullet after it passes through a golden Christmas globe filled with yellow gelatin like in the photo above!  Here's a video describing the  Projectile Module .      Taken with the Sound Module      The Sound Module  detects noise such as the ""pop"" from the yellow balloon above.ÃÂÃÂ  We just set the Sound Module a few feet away from the balloon and the Camera Axe 6 took care of the rest.ÃÂÃÂ  It is also great for explosions and the crunch of a hammer on an egg.  Here's a video detailing the  Sound Module .      Taken with the Valve Module      TheÃÂÃÂ   Valve Module  lets you photograph liquid droplets by controlling a solenoid to create water droplets at just the right time and size so sculptural looking collisions happen.ÃÂÃÂ  An automatic mode helps you handle the initial timing.ÃÂÃÂ  Here's a video describing the  Valve Module .      Taken with the Vibration Module      The Vibration Module  detects small vibrations.ÃÂÃÂ  It can be placed on a table to detect taps on the table, which effectively turns the whole table into a giant trigger button.ÃÂÃÂ  Another use case is detecting when a watermelon hits the wall.ÃÂÃÂ  Here's a video for more information about the  Vibration Module .      Image of the Dev Module      The Dev Module  is short for ""Development Module"".  It incorporates a button that can cause a trigger and exposes all the signal pins to make it easier for people to design their own modules using different sensors and circuitry. Here's a video detailing the  Dev Module .  High-Speed Photography   There are many definitions for high-speed photography, but for the Camera Axe 6 it generally means events that are too fast for human reflexes.  Incredibly fast events like photographing a bullet in flight are cases where you don't actually use the camera shutter to take a photo since cameras have too much shutter lag.ÃÂÃÂ  Shutter lag is the duration of time from when the shutter is triggered to when the shutter is opened so the image can be captured. Flash lag is around a thousand times smaller than shutter lag, so you will use flashes for these types of high speed events.ÃÂÃÂ  When you want to capture something too fast for the shutter, you must open your shutter for a long duration of time and use a flash to capture the action in a dark room. The Camera Axe 6 can do all of this for you! It begins by triggering the camera shutter and then separately triggering a flash at just the right time. With the right Dev Module circuity, the Camera Axe 6 could even turn off the room lights for you.      Photo taken in a dark room with a flash     Other events that aren't that fast can trigger the camera directly.  Examples of these might be photographing birds in flight or people crossing a finish line in a race.  In many of these cases a human could anticipate the photo and take the picture themselves; however, having the Camera Axe 6 means you can automate these types of photos so you don't need to sit there for hours waiting to get the shot.      Photo taken directly with camera (no flash used)      Here is a slide deck ÃÂÃÂ I made about high-speed photography that explains these concepts in more depth.  Camera Axe 6 Latency  Typical human reflexes are around 150-250 milliseconds.  In some testing I found the Camera Axe 6 responds in about 3 microseconds.  That is more than 50,000 times faster than a typical human reflex.  Another way to think about speed is how far the objects you are photographing move while the Camera Axe 6 is being triggered.  One of the fastest things I photograph are shooting bullets that are traveling around the speed of sound.  In the 3 microseconds of lag from the Camera Axe 6 a bullet will travel 0.04 inches (1 mm).  Shutter lag on cameras are around 70 milliseconds and even flash delays are in the 50 microsecond range.  The delay from the Camera Axe 6 is very small compared to those latencies.    Add all this up and it's clear the Camera Axe 6 is incredibly fast.    Connecting to the Camera Axe 6      Two of the web pages used to control the Camera Axe 6     Connecting to the Camera Axe 6 is incredibly easy. It runs a web server so you just go to the web page for your Camera Axe 6 and you can start inputting your settings.ÃÂÃÂ  Using the browser on your phone or laptop means you can change settings from across the room without disturbing your carefully setup scene.ÃÂÃÂ  For instance, you might change the delays to your camera/flash, the module settings to control factors like how loud of a noise causes a trigger event, or intervalometer settings.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   The Camera Axe 6 can operate in direct mode where it runs its own Wi-Fi network and your phone or laptop connects directly to it.ÃÂÃÂ  This mode is nice if you aren't at a location where you have a Wi-Fi router like the bottom of the Grand Canyon.ÃÂÃÂ  The other option is you can connect your Camera Axe 6 to your local Wi-Fi router and then any device on that Wi-Fi network can access the Camera Axe 6.ÃÂÃÂ   This connection guide ÃÂÃÂ explains all the details on how to connect the Camera Axe 6.   Here is a video  that walks you through the UI menus on the Camera Axe 6.   Supported Cameras and Flashes  A recommended camera for the Camera Axe 6 is one that will allow full manual control of aperture, ISO, and shutter speed.ÃÂÃÂ  It will also be in this  list of cameras that are supported .ÃÂÃÂ  If a camera you have isn't on the list and it does have a dedicated shutter release cable feel free to  contact me  to see if it can be adapted and added to the list.ÃÂÃÂ  If your camera isn't supported, you can still use your camera in manual mode with a long exposure in a dark room.ÃÂÃÂ  In this case the Camera Axe 6 will just be used to trigger a flash.  An ideal flash for the Camera Axe 6 is one that supports manual power levels and short duration (1/30,000th of a second).ÃÂÃÂ  Many studio flashes aren't the best fit because they have longer flash durations in an attempt to get better light quality.ÃÂÃÂ  The Canon and Nikon flashes with manual controls are very good but expensive.ÃÂÃÂ  I recommend the Yongnuo 460 flashes because they are low cost and have worked perfectly with the Camera Axe 6.ÃÂÃÂ  The Camera Axe 6 ships with either hotshoe flash cables or PC-Sync flash cables.ÃÂÃÂ  Some flashes might use a 3.5mm jack which can be bought very inexpensively online (3.5mm male/male stereo cable).  Camera Axe 6 Hardware  The Camera Axe 6 is optimized for high-speed photography, so you never have to miss amoment. You can be sure that Camera Axe 6 triggers super-fast every time. In fact, thereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a dedicatedprocessor ensuring that you get perfectly reproducible results.  The Camera Axe 6 has two main processing units.ÃÂÃÂ  One is the ARM based ATSAM3X, which is the one that handles the critical timing of reading the module ports and then triggering the camera ports.ÃÂÃÂ  The other processor is the ESP8266, which handles processing the incoming and outgoing Wi-Fi signals.  The external ports on the Camera Axe 6 are shown in the following image.         The Camera Axe 6 is powered either by the USB port or with 4 AA batteries, which will last about 12 hours.ÃÂÃÂ  If you want longer life use a  USB power bank .ÃÂÃÂ  The Camera Axe 6 uses about 220 mA so if you get an economical 22,000 mAh battery pack which should last around 100 hours.  The Camera Axe 6 case and all the module cases will have 1/4""-20 threaded mounting holes so they can be attached to tripods or other standard photography brackets.  There is a detailed  Camera Axe 6 Design Guide  that goes into hardware and software in much more detail if you are interested.         Camera Axe 6 Software  All the code is currently in a private GitHub repository and it will be made public after shipping the Camera AxeÃÂÃÂ 6 to backers.ÃÂÃÂ  People who back the ""Beta Program"" reward level will get earlier access to this code.ÃÂÃÂ  There is already a  detailed guide written for how to update your firmware  that gives more detail on all this, and I made a video about how to add a  new menu here .  There are three major pieces of software for the Camera Axe 6.  First there is the low-level code that runs on the ATSAM3X.ÃÂÃÂ  It can be extended in the Arduino IDE (this is a free and easy to use coding platform).ÃÂÃÂ  This is the code that watches the module ports and then triggers the camera ports with very strict timing requirements.  Second there is code that run on the ESP8266.ÃÂÃÂ  This layer mostly just passes information from the Wi-Fi network to the ATSAM3X.ÃÂÃÂ  This code can also be extended through the Arduino IDE.  Third there is the code that runs in the browser.ÃÂÃÂ  This includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.ÃÂÃÂ  This code is stored on the ESP8266 which runs a webserver and serves it to whatever phone or laptop you're using to access the web page.  More Information   Here is a new forum I recently setup for the Camera Axe.   Feel free to post questions there since I monitor it closely.  Here is the  Camera Axe 6 user guide  that explains the different menus and how they work.ÃÂÃÂ   If you're interested in more photos than on this page I've uploaded a gallery of high resolution  images of the Camera Axe 6 and photos taken by the Camera Axe 6 here .  If you prefer videos,  here is my High-Speed Photography playlist on YouTube .ÃÂÃÂ   You will notice there are a lot of technical details about this project on this page.  I am committed to making the Camera Axe 6 easy to use for beginners, but I do strongly believe providing the technical details for this type of product is important so that photographers who want to can grow their knowledge and become power users.  Credits  Dan Lenardon contributed all the lightning photos.ÃÂÃÂ  He used a Camera Axe 5, the predecessor to the 6, with an early prototype Light Module.  I took all the rest of the photos and video.ÃÂÃÂ  All the high-speed photos were taken with prototype Camera Axe 6s.ÃÂÃÂ  Except for two photos of bullets going through water dropletsÃÂÃÂ which were shown as old coverage from YouTube and were captured using a Camera Axe 5.  The two songs in the video areÃÂÃÂ Eine Kleine Nachtmusik by Mozart andÃÂÃÂ Rabid by Ethan Meixsell.ÃÂÃÂ  Both have free to use licensing  terms.  The British voice in the video was done by from a voice actor.ÃÂÃÂ  Oddly the service I used doesn't give his name or a way to contact him so I can't provide those details here.ÃÂÃÂ  I do have rights to use the recordings he did for me.ÃÂÃÂ   Here is his Voiver page .       Risks and challenges  I'm far along in the design.  The version of the Camera Axe 6 I used to take the photos used on this page is fully functional and already much better than any other trigger I've used.  That said, there are still some known software bugs I need to fix.  However, I'm confident I can fix the issues I currently know about so these are minimal risk.  The current plan for manufacturing is the PCB boards will be assembled by a factory in China that I've used before and does high quality work.  The main case for the Camera Axe 6 and for many of the modules will be injection molded.  I'm currently using 3d printed cases and will need to get a mold made once I finalize the case design.  Some of the modules will use laser cut plastic pieces for their cases.  I am leaving some extra time in the schedule to allow some minor changes based on input from Kickstarter backers.  Depending on what ideas come from the community there is some risk that the final product could be delayed as I make it better.  I will know more after I hear what innovative ideas you have.  There are always risks with manufacturing hardware.  One type of risk is that if there are many more backers than I anticipate then I might need to adjust the manufacturing methods I plan to use.  Another risk is there could be some delays in getting components needed to make the Camera Axe 6.  If either of these becomes a problem I would certainly let you know as soon as possible.  I have done three Kickstarter projects, and all have been delivered either ahead of schedule or on time.  I am very proud of that record and have a lot of experience planning for small to medium size manufacturing.  I will do my very best to deliver this project on time and will always be open in my communications to backers."

Kiwi 4 will be our 11th Kickstarter project. We're absolutely confident we can do the job.  Electrical Engineering - We don't expect any significant problems to arise as this has been our area of expertise for over a decade. If a problem were to arise, it would be in the assembly process of the electronics. Small components may not be soldered properly onto the printed circuit board thus creating unreliable electrical connections. This could potentially cause a few weeks of delay. To combat this, our electrical engineers will be working closely with our overseas partners to adhere to our strict quality standards.  Computer Engineering - We also don't expect any significant problems as this is also our area of expertise. If a problem were to arise, it would be in detecting bugs in the software code which could hinder Kiwi 4 from fully functioning. To combat this, a simple rewrite of the software code will solve any problems that may arise.  We already have our manufacturing all setup in some of the world's best factories which adhere to internationally recognized quality standards and procedures such as ISO9001, ISO/TS 16949, ISO 14000, TQM, SPC.  The prototypes are finished and we're ready to go into production. We need your help and we hope you'll join us."

NATEDE Premium  will also include an additional sensor for carbon dioxide (COÃÂ¢<U+0082><U+0082>).            The new NATEDE mobile app (available for iOS and Android) allows users to  monitor the air quality  in their space. NATEDE connects to your  home or office Wi-Fi , so you can manage NATEDE from everywhere. It features also  Bluetooth , which makes the first connection and setup much easier.       NATEDEÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s mobile app dashboard shows  real-time monitoring of the IAQ (Internal Air Quality) . The wave frequency changes depending on the IAQ levels.       From the mobile app itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s possible to manage NATEDEÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s  fan speed  and select one of the four available operating modes.  It's also possible to see a  detailed breakdown  of the pollutants in your environment.       NATEDEÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s app features a  Statistics section  where you can monitor the levels of the measured elements such as humidity, temperature, VOCs, PM2.5 and CO. Premium users will also be able to monitor COÃÂ¢<U+0082><U+0082> levels.       When NATEDE detects high levels of pollutants in the air,  its app will send a notification  and it will ask for information on your activity to better understand  your habits  and tailor the experience to  your needs.         The core technology of NATEDE is phytoremediation , which means that it uses the natural power of common plants to clean toxins in the air. This was studied by NASA in the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>80s and implemented by Clairy with almost 3 years of research at  PNAT and LINV, two of the most important laboratories on plants neurobiology in the world.ÃÂÃÂ                   Plants placed in NATEDE metabolize a significantly higher amount of pollutants as opposed to plants potted in regular vases given that the  air purification process  happens throughout the whole plant, including its roots.  NATEDE also features a  new and improved technology unit  that supercharges this effect.       NATEDE combines  phytoremediation  with a new incredible filtration process:  photocatalysis. ÃÂÃÂ        NATEDE's superpowers come from the so-called  photocatalysis : light energy kick-starts a process that zaps all kinds of nasty air pollutants and turns them into harmless substances instead.   For people who suffer from asthma and allergies , the NATEDE light-powered air purifier is a great ally to breathe clean air and improve your health.  The photocatalytic filter inside NATEDE can capture and eliminate VOCs, viruses and bacteria, and it can significantly alleviate odors from pets, cigarettes and cigars, cooking, mildew, etc.  And the best part of photocatalysis is that  this filter does not need any replacement!                              NATEDEÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s technology has been scientifically tested    PLANTS   ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s now more than 3 years that we have been testing our products and our technology.  Our main partners are PNAT and LINV , the most prestigious research labs on plants neurobiology in Europe, both spin-offs of the University of Florence, Italy. PNAT and LINV proved the effectiveness of our system and work closely with us to improve our products.   Results from 2016 PNAT/LINV analysis    Additional 2017/2018 PNAT/LINV analysis    FLUID DYNAMICS   After the success of our first Kickstarter campaign back in 2016, we started working with  fluid dynamics engineers  to perfect the airflow and to improve the purification range. NATEDE has an incredible purification range and guarantees a perfect and silent air flow.   See results    PHOTOCATALYSIS   Photocatalysis is a natural process by which the light strikes a mineral (titanium dioxide - TiOÃÂ¢<U+0082><U+0082> - a common mineral) and activates a chemical process that securely and instantaneously oxidizes and decomposes the organic matter at the molecular level to form water vapor and small parts of carbon dioxide. The  combination of photocatalysis with the plant  is just perfect and guarantees a great improvement in performance.

And if you need a  good sleep  to be ready for an intense day tomorrow, just make sure you breathe good air during the night.            The Internet of Things (IoT) is a scenario in which objects, devices, and sensors are given the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.   NATEDE can connect to other smart home devices , such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home, who will directly report the quality of the air you breathe and will be able to manage it with voice commands.            NATEDE features a  proximity sensor that lets you turn it ON an OFF  by simply moving your hand close to it. NATEDE is science, but you can do your little magic here.            NATEDE features an intuitive LED guide that lets you see the quality of your air without checking the app.                           NATEDE features a self-watering system, which helps to further  reduce water consumption  ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> in addition to keeping plants alive while we are on the move or on long holidays - its water tank can  bring water to plants for about a month.                  NATEDE's new photocatalytic filter, combined with the increased efficiency of the air flow, will also reduceÃÂÃÂ  smoke, cooking, and bathroom odors.             NATEDE has a green soul: it is Made in Italy with sustainable materials often derived from natural waste.ÃÂÃÂ    At Clairy, we are committed to a green lifestyle,  we respect our planet, and while NATEDE purifies your air from harmful elements that can affect your health  we are keen on avoiding an impact on our planet.ÃÂÃÂ    This is why we spent 2 years looking for the best combination of these materials.       We have created NATEDE starting from the concept of  ""Circular Design Economy"" , which refers to a sustainable design that thinks about our future.ÃÂÃÂ   NATEDE is respectful to the environment in multiple ways: in its use of  natural materials , in the  lack of added harmful glues , and in its  sustainable dismantling  at the end of its lifecycle.ÃÂÃÂ   As a  Nature-loving company , we leverage nature and we aim to preserve it as best as we can.

No more confusion about where to start, how to get started, what comes next or what can you do with what youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve learned. This isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t just a degree, itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a guide. Starting at the very beginning with the essentials and fundamentals, you will go through step-by-step to actually understand and learn DevOps.

This unique degree will ensure that you are completely prepared for a career in DevOps.    What is DevOps?         DevOps is a set of practices that aim to automate the process by combining practices and tools between software development and the testing teams release applications and services at a faster rate. It breaks the traditional form of development set ups that result in ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0098>siloingÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> development and operations teams and instead creates a new method where there is a continuous conversation.ÃÂÃÂ   Under this method, engineers work across the entire application lifestyle from the start including development, deployment, testing and are not limited to only a single task, instead develop a range of skills. This ensures that quality assurance and security teams also become more integrated with the development and operations teams to ensure a top-notch product!  DevOps comes with a number of different benefits that can be across the entire organization:   Speed:  A major chunk of the time when it comes to app development and deployment is wasted in waiting. The periods of waiting where the app is shipped from one department to another add a considerable amount of time in the app development process. With DevOps, the process is streamlined which means less time is wasted and things move much faster and more efficiently.ÃÂÃÂ    Faster Delivery:  A more streamlined and automated process ensures that your app is delivered faster. Each release can be worked on and deployed more rapidly.ÃÂÃÂ    Quality:  Since continuous integration and continuous deployment are primary processes in DevOps, it ensures a complete transparent working environment. This creates a better management system between the teams which results in more quality work across all streams.ÃÂÃÂ    Improved Collaboration:  The DevOps model results in more team activities, which means that you require building strong teams that work exceptionally well along with one other. This strategy requires a ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0098>systems thinkingÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> approach that results in employees becoming aware of how your actions not only affect the individual person but also the entire team and the product.ÃÂÃÂ    Increased Security:  While you sacrifice some security benefits when automating, but a more hands-off approach and collaborative environment ensures that your apps are built to offer the best security you can offer.  This 3-month dedicated program will include numerous labs, quizzes, projects and exams at the end of each course. Once completed, you will be awarded an e-degree which will reflect your performance and your score from each course.  ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s not all, there will also be webinars, moderated forums, reviews and instructor support that enhance your learning experience!   DevOps as a Career        ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   DevOps is growing today at a fast pace as more companies are turning towards this method to streamline their development and deployment process. The collaboration between the teams not only results in apps being built faster, but also ensures apps are bigger and better.  DevOps has shown great promise in 2017, and is expected to grow even more in this year. According to Research Company, Forester, DevOps is expected to reach $7.72 billion by 2021, a growth of 33% annually.  Their research also revealed the number of companies that have already implemented DevOps in 2018 and also the ones that are interested in implementing and expanding this process. This shows that 50% of the business reviewed were actually interested using DevOps within their organisation.  This makes right now the best time to become a master DevOps and its technologies to get an edge in the market!

Without the use of water tanks, we were able to condense the size of the Beverage Bar to 320 x 330 x 361 making it one of the smallest water purifiers on the market with a multi-function beverage system.                 Osmosis is on a mission to help you lead a healthier lifestyle starting from within.ÃÂÃÂ   Water, Coffee, and Tea all have their own unique benefits for our bodies but these benefits are often compromised by the water we use as the base for our beverages.  This is why we are on a mission to bring you an appliance like the Osmosis Beverage Bar to eliminate the harmful pollutants at the source, your home or office water supply.

We understand that the quality of water directly affects the taste of the beverage.  We have also noticed that many homeowners adopting smart home devices, we sought out to create 3-in1- beverage bar with integrated tech features for all your home beverage needs.  With over 7 years of producing water purification machines and appliances, we have established ourselves as a reputable producer of products scientifically efficient and paired with todayÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s technology."

Also, it is great for parents that need to get the children up in the morning. Let Snoozle do the work for you, while you use your time in other ways like preparing breakfast for the family.  ÃÂÃÂ         Snoozle  makes your day easier by giving you more time in the morning. Have time for a healthy breakfast, plan your day, hit the gym, or anything else you might be missing out on.  ÃÂÃÂ         Where do you start your morning routine?   Whether you are the type of person that likes to go running in the morning, play the guitar, open the refrigerator, drink a cup of water, or just play with your pet duck... Snoozle will make your morning easier and will get your started.  ÃÂÃÂ         How does Snoozle work?   ÃÂÃÂ   Snoozle is made out of 2 components:  ÃÂÃÂ   1-The Snoozle alarm clock.  ÃÂÃÂ   2-The Snoozle base.  ÃÂÃÂ   Place the alarm next to your bed, but the Snoozle base should be placed wherever you start your morning routine. This might be in the bathroom, kitchen, closet, gym, refrigerator etc.  ÃÂÃÂ   Snoozle works like a regular alarm clock, but the only difference is that the alarm only stops when you place it on top of the Snoozle base. This will make your morning easier and get up and start your day.  ÃÂÃÂ   Easy as that.   ÃÂÃÂ         Why choose Snoozle?   ÃÂÃÂ   -Add precious time to your everyday life  ÃÂÃÂ   -Full of energy throughout the day  ÃÂÃÂ   -Feel more optimistic  ÃÂÃÂ   -Get out of bed on time  ÃÂÃÂ         LED display   ÃÂÃÂ   Snoozle has a bright LED light that lights up the screen. This works great for seeing what time it is at night, and also as a night light.  ÃÂÃÂ         Here are a few reviews from people that have tried waking up with the prototypes:   ÃÂÃÂ        Contribute to Snoozle for yourself, or get it as the perfect gift for someone that is always late to meetings.           Risks and challenges  During this project (while building the prototypes and Kickstarter campaign) we have already encountered many challenges and problems that we had to find solutions to. While building the prototype we were sent the wrong components from manufacturers on multiple accounts, but we have solved them all and now have a functioning prototype.  Now we see a few risks that might come up during the project that might make it more challenging for us.  1. Marketing and not raising the goal we set in order to mass manufactor Snoozle.  - We have found outside investors from Italy that will invest in our product if we raise half the money on Kickstarter which will show that this product is something that people want. We also ask for your help in sharing the campaign on social media with friends if you think Snoozle is a cool product.  2. Manufacturing delays.  - We minimized this risk by lining up 3 manufacturers, so in case one doesn't come through, we have 2 more lined up. There is always a risk that the components we need might not be available in the quantity that we need. This all depends on how many backers we will have and how many Snoozle alarm clocks we will have to manufacture.  We commit to giving you frequent updates on the progress of the manufacturing process, packaging, and delivery of Snoozle. We want to make you part of the process and feedback is always welcome."

There is so much to be done. The last few years I started a project called 'Light Salone', with the aim of providing small-scale renewable energy to rural areas in Sierra Leone. We are a team of 10 people working passionately to innovate, with low-cost engineering solutions  In 2017 I was awarded Innovator of the year in Sierra Leone by the UNDP for my work on electricity. Over the years I have being working on providing electricity for my community through innovative ways of recycling waste material to valuable energy machines that can generate electricity for homes and small businesses. My work includes the following: hydro generator built from spoons with an output of 220Volts; fuel free generator with an output of 300watts; a solar book for students living in remote environments to study and access electricity using our solar book; a Wind mill built from scraps; Energy saving stove for home uses; Power banks for charging Laptops, phones etc; generating electricity from vegetables like,tomatoes, potatoes, orange, lemons with an output of 5Volts to charge your phone and light up LED bulbs. All these are built from recycling materials which makes them cheap to build and more accessible in our scarce rural environment.  My project through Kickstarter is to expand these pilot projects through my newly created social enterprise, Light Salone, developing multiple prototypes that can be sold or purchased through grants to provide electricity to rural communities. I hope to develop this work further for large scale electricity production so that I increase the output of the generators, make them more efficient and replicate it to many more communities across Africa,My Dream is to light up the African continent from being called the darkest continent to be called the lantern continent, I hope to contribute in making the Sierra Leonean economy grow, and electricity is invaluable for communities as well as for attracting investors and other developmental programmes. Africa needs our energy solutions to be able to move further with development programmes because electricity contribute in all aspect of development ranging from education, health, communication, businesses etc.  In Achieving this ambition, I need people like you to help me achieve this dream for Sierra Leone, you can help by support my crowdfunding page and donate the amount you are willing to help.Your Donation Will Help thousands of people in Africa especially school going students to study at night, hospitals to light at night, promoting our culture of storytelling at night, provide electricity for market women to sell at night etc. Help me make this happen!  If you have experience and ideas of how to scale this type of technology, do get in touch - it's always great to speak and learn from other entrepreneurs!  Please see my Youtube channel for examples of past projects that we hope to professionalise and scale, like we did with the So Wind (solar + wind turbine).  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCazdJtVHinsh03yqzjHQW5g/videos      Risks and challenges  The main risk and challenge of the project is to make it financially successful. It is always challenging to turn a prototype into a model that pays for itself sustainably. I currently have a strong network of mentors and supporters who are helping me both with the technical aspects of the project as well as the business and financial planning. I will work hard with them to develop a sustainable model for the future that will allow me to scale beyond the individual projects, to a self-funding business that provides electricity."

In short, we can confidently say that you will receive the best product we can deliver in a timely manner.  A large amount of resources have been dedicated to development, prototyping, and manufacturability. We cannot wait to get this product in our backers' hands! We have surpassed the prototype phase and have had samples manufactured in a ""mass-produced"" fashion to ensure high quality at scale. On top of this, our supply chain has been tested and has a 100% success rate of on time delivery.  All our ducks are in a row (..a very straight and well tested row), and now we just need support from backers to push this business into reality.  The risks we face are those that every business faces. For example, there is always a risk of hazardous shipping conditions from overseas. There also may be a risk of domestic shipping damage. Don't worry! If that happens, we'll replace any products that have been damaged during shipping. While we feel it is very minimal, there is always a risk of faulty electrical wiring. Again, if this is the manufacturer's error, we will certainly replace damaged products.  We're excited and will keep backers informed every step of the way."

What does this mean? The music is pretty much composed by your brainwaves. The music will reflect how you're feeling. If you're happy, the music composition will be fast-paced. If you're relaxed, the music composition will be calm. Incredible isn't it?!

Let Luuna's artificial intelligence soothe you with calming music as you doze off into a peaceful slumber.    POWER NAP Luuna's app features a power nap mode just in case you only need a few short minutes to recharge your mind, energy, and help you boost your brain's learning capacity.

EEG IS MORE ACCURATEÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that detects electrical activity in your brain using small, flat metal discs (electrodes). Your brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are active all the time, even when you're asleep.ÃÂÃÂ   EEG monitoring is the most accurate and effective way to track brain activity sleep stages. Entertech has one of the most accurate EEG dry acquisition technology in the world and the most accurate algorithms for automatic sleep tracking and analysis. But for users suffering from sleep issues, they need more than monitoring. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why we developed brainwave-AI music. Luuna generate music which is created based on usersÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> real-time brainwaves.

The Forehead Three-electrode EEG acquisition Program is our new development proposed because of Luuna. People who know EEG would know that most EEG acquisitions need a reference electrode on the ear, which will greatly limit product design. The fulfillment and effectiveness of this new program highly boost our confidence in Luuna. We have also integrated the EEG acquisition module. In Luuna, there is the smallest EEG acquisition module in the world, as small as your thumbnail with a Bluetooth module in it. The power consumption can be at least 1 milliamp.  Designs and working prototypes have been developed. Small-batch production went smoothly. We are ready to begin manufacturing. Based on our experience of production and distribution worldwide with our last crowdfunding campaign, we are confident that we will be able to produce the final product with exceptional quality and to also complete it on time. By the end of this Kickstarter campaign, we should already have some product in stock. Our delivery times are expected to meet all set deadlines.  Thank you for having trust Entertech. We really appreciate your decision to back us."

Now, although we arenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t quite there yet on the super strength or X-Ray vision, we have cracked open super hearingÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦ well technically  infrasonic  hearing!       The Raspberry Boom home monitor detects ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>infraÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ sounds, or extremely low frequencies of sound, that are completely imperceivable to your ears. These sounds are less than ~20 Hz, or the lower limit of what is audible to humans, and Raspberry Boom can detect them from great distances all around your local region.               ÃÂÃÂ     Imagine   what you could detect at home with your very own Raspberry Boom ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦                         SO WHAT CAN YOU DISCOVER/ DETECT?  The easy answer is ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>More than you would think!ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ. You will be surprised just how many things actually generate infrasonic signals:       Yes you read correctly  IF  an alien ship enters our atmosphere or Superman decided to pop in for a visit, your Raspberry Boom would likely detect it!... Hmmm anyone near Area 51 ?!ÃÂÃÂ   Infrasound sensors detect so many intriguing things happening all around you. Independently they can uncover some pretty cool mysteries, but together, using our Raspberry Shake connected network, they create an array that can potentially track and locate events. From incoming harsh weather, planes flying overhead, gun fire and nuclear testing, to volcanoes erupting on remote islands in the Pacific Ocean and meteors exploding overheadÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦ Detect all these and more- DISCOVER the untold secrets that are out there with the Raspberry Boom!    RASPBERRY BOOM DEMONSTRATION       Depending on your geographical location and proximity, you will measure infrasound from different sources. Remember with the Raspberry Shake ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> Station View ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ array, you will be able to see activity from all over the world from all the different Raspberry Booms interconnected to our online map! So even if you don't live in tornado country or on the flanks of an active volcano, you will be able to access data from other users who do.   MEET THE RASPBERRY BOOM    A must have for makers and enthusiasts of all stripes!    Watch this techy video to meet the Raspberry Boom prototypes:      VIGOROUS TESTING AND MAYBE EVEN A WORLD RECORD!  Testing of the Raspberry Boom, which began last year, has brought us to some very cool places. At Raspberry Shake we are all huge SpaceX fans and we couldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t resist putting a Raspberry Boom through its paces with the recent launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket. And it was well worth it. We successfully captured clear recordings of the launch sequence and the 3 sonic booms that accompanied each rocket as they made their way back to Earth and into the history books. Who said the sky was the limit?       And with the help of Daniel Bowman we are taking the Raspberry Boom into Space alsoÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦ well the stratosphere at least, and hopefully setting a  New World Record  while we are at it. Danny is an expert solar balloon builder, having launched his first balloon when he was fifteen years old and continuing with flights that have reached over 80,000 ft (24,000 m) high.  Danny has built and testing a 42 ft (12.8 m) diameter solar balloon with the hopes of reaching heights around 100,000 ft - ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s over 30 kmÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s/ 18 miles high!  ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Our goal is to get the most outrageous altitude possible. I want to go up at least 80,000 ft but my dream is 100,000 ft. We may make it with your flight!ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ  The balloon will have a payload of a Raspberry Boom, and other monitoring equipment to document and record the mission. What better way to test the Boom under extreme conditions?! The launch is programmed to take place during this campaign, so make sure to follow our social networks @raspishake and campaign hashtags #BoomBalloon &amp; #RaspberryBoom to ensure you donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t miss it!  At stratospheric heights wind noise is negligible and infrasound energy is concentrated, so we canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t wait to see what the Raspberry Boom detects and of course the black-sky imagery we will get up there will be spectacular!        According to Danny, ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>In order to set a world record we must break the altitude reached by Malaterre, 1993: the author reports a 30 km altitude for his solar/infrared balloon. I believe that, by beating this, we could claim both the highest solar powered flight and highest hot air balloon flight. I will not guarantee success but I think we have a good chance of hitting it.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ To add to the suspense of the flight, we will be launching in New Mexico where it is quite windy this time of year. These types of balloons can be fairly fragile and rip apart, due to their lightweight nature. For a successful flight and to ensure the safety of the balloon we will have to carefully monitor the weather.   Wish us GOOD LUCK!!!        HOW DOES IT WORK?  For those of you who have heard about the Raspberry Shake, our flagship personal earthquake monitoring device (or seismograph), you will know that it is built on the most popular single board computer in the tech world- the ""Raspberry Pi"" computer.  The Raspberry Boom is no different, giving existing Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Shake owners the flexibility to start detecting infrasound just by adding the Boom board and sensor! And if you don't already have one, you can pick up a plug &amp; play version at a great price in our rewards section. The infrasound sensor will unlock the Raspberry Pi's ability to detect those sound waves from ~0.05 Hz to 20 Hz that are completely inaudible to the human ear.      The circuit board incorporates a powerful 24 bit digitizer, sampling infrasound at 100 samples per second with data transmission rates of four packets per second. This makes the Raspberry Boom extremely accurate and a force to be reckoned with for other professional sensors out there that cost thousands.  Just like the rest of our product range, the Raspberry Boom comes with  many DIY options:  Grab the STL/DXF files from diy.raspberryshake.org and build your own enclosure, or grab the microSD card image and start writing your own software routines in order to integrate the data into your personal website. Turnkey plug and play solutions are also available.ÃÂÃÂ   For those of you looking for an all in one solution to combine our Earth motion seismograph and infrasound sensors in a single unit, check out the Shake &amp; Boom rewards. If you already have a Raspberry Shake, there is a reward available so that you can easily swap out your Raspberry Shake board with the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0098>Shake and BoomÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>. This gives you the best of both worlds, allowing you to detect what is happening right beneath your feet and the atmosphere all around you.  FEATURES       Technical specifications here:  https://manual.raspberryshake.org/specifications.html#techspecs   ATTENTION DO IT YOURSELFERS!  Build your own Raspberry Boom sensor and become a kind of detective to explore the unheard symphony of infrasound happening all around you.       The Raspberry Boom Do It Yourself resources are already available! This means that you can already start laser cutting or 3D printing your enclosures or just start learning about the ins and outs of the new Raspberry Boom.  Some DIY resources:  -   Do It Yourself website   - links to the SD card image and DXF/ STL files for laser cutting and 3D printing can be found here  -   The ManualÃÂÃÂ     WORLDWIDE DETECTION NETWORK  Thanks to YOUR help we have developed the largest independent citizen science network of interconnected Earth and atmospheric monitoring devices worldwide! Everyday new devices are coming online from all over the planet. Reserve your Boom today and join the largest citizen science powered community in the world.       Your Raspberry Boom, once online, will strengthen this network. Any Raspberry Boom user in the network can access the infrasound signals from any other user in the network. So someone in California can connect to a Raspberry Boom installed beside Etna Volcano in Italy and watch the volcanic explosions happening-   in real-time!    The Raspberry Boom on its own is an incredibly powerful device, but when they link together across the community's network, they create an array that can potentially track and triangulate interesting events (We still donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t know how much of this is possible, because quite simply, it has never been tried before! But we have proven the potential already with our  earthquake monitoring network  where Raspberry Shakers all over the world are detecting their own earthquakes all the time independently of big government organizations.). This could quickly become the largest worldwide network (citizen science-powered or otherwise) of interconnected infrasound devices that are continuously monitoring our planet.   We are incredibly excited by this!  - Can you imagine what we'll discover together???   MOBILE APPÃÂÃÂ   Receive real time streaming information from your Raspberry Boom and connected devices, direct to your phone with the EQ info app for your android phone, in the    Google Play store   .       The app will be updated to stream live infrasound data from around the globe, in addition to the earthquake notifications it alreadyÃÂÃÂ shows on the interactive map.  REWARDS   To thank all of you for your support weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll add you to the Movers and Shakers section of our website!

Risks and challenges  The biggest challenge for us was bringing the cost of the unit down to an affordable price for the consumer. Infrasound sensors are extremely expensive and in fact the sensor alone is roughly 3 times the price of the sensor we used in our previous Earth Motion devices.   Getting a fully functional home science infrasound monitor into your hands is not a risk. This is now proven tech which benefits from everything we learned from our first two successful Kickstarter campaigns and the creation of the 'Raspberry Shake' earthquake monitor. We have built various prototypes of the 'Boom' and 'Shake and Boom' which are installed in the field and working incredibly well, so the only thing left is to tidy up the software, go into mass production and get you your very own infrasonic monitor!  During the campaign itself, however, there are a few risksÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦ We aim to launch a Raspberry Boom into the stratosphere on a Solar Balloon. The balloon is HUGE and March/April has some of the windiest weather at our launch site, so there are a number of risks for a successful balloon launch.   Risks of the balloon launch include:  - Good balloon launching weather - Possibility of the balloon ripping prior to launch - Possibility of the balloon bursting as it ascends - Technical failures due to extreme temperatures/weather - The balloon catching thermals and staying in the stratosphere for days (this would be cool though!) - Losing the balloon completely (very unlikely as we will have a tracker on board)  Wish us luck and stay up to date of the balloon launch on social media @raspishake by following the hashtags #BoomBalloon #RaspberryBoom"

We want to create a network for women in IT that arranges regular inspirational events and raises the awareness of the possibilities, attractiveness and diversity of the IT-industry.ÃÂÃÂ WiTech willÃÂÃÂ be a natural place for women to develop their competenceÃÂÃÂ and skills,ÃÂÃÂ and also be ableÃÂÃÂ to share their competence and skillsÃÂÃÂ with other women.   We also have a strong commitment to inspire the next generation of girls to join the IT-industry or choose an IT-education. WiTech also aims to create female role models who can show the diversity of IT and inspire young girls.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    How did it begin?   Due to an over representation of men within the IT-industry and a lack of female role models, a lot of women often feel alone in the industry. There are still a lot of stereotypical thoughts and prejudices about what kind of people that works with IT. Usually, this stereotypical person is a male developer.ÃÂÃÂ   The number of IT related education programs are increasing as well as the number of applicants, but the number of female applicants are still relatively low. Sweden, compared to other parts of the world, has a much lower share of women in IT related programs and professions.ÃÂÃÂ   The idea for the network comes from the increasing demand and interest in connecting women working with IT and to create a platform that enables this. The women engaged in the network so far have a strong will to inspire the next generation of women to choose an IT related education program or profession. We want to show the next generation of girls the variety of roles within the field and present female role models to look up to.     Women networking at our first event     Why should you support us?   To this date there are 128 registered women in the network from VÃÂÃÂ¤xjÃÂÃÂ¶ and Kalmar in Sweden. The women in the network represent different higher education establishments, students, municipality's and over 30 businesses in the region. The large number of women that are engaged in the network so far shows that there is a need to meet and share a common platform. We want to make this network work long term and in a sustainable way. Here are some examples of what your contribution could support:ÃÂÃÂ    Build a solid platform for the network to grow from  Arrange meetings for networking and knowledge exchange  Create inspirational events and conferences  Seminars and worskhops at local schools  Participate as exhibitor at eventsÃÂÃÂ   Marketing material  Eventually maybe get a project manager for the networkÃÂÃÂ   Support the expansion of WiTech into other cities    WiTech has four main goals   At WiTech's kick-off, 24th of November, approximenty 60 women joined and participated in a workshop in which they got to express what the network should work with. We got 58 answers and from these we could easy see a pattern leading us to our four goals.ÃÂÃÂ    Meeting place to network    ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> Create a chance for women from different orientations within IT to meet and expand their networks, both socially and to create new work related possibilities   Knowledge exchange and development of competence    ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> Share knowledge, competence and updates between researchers, students and professionals within the network.ÃÂÃÂ    InspirationÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> Inspirational events and conferences for the women in the network. Inspire industry, parents, teachers and guidance counselors.   Inspire next generation of girls to IT   - Show young girls the diversity and attractiveness in IT.ÃÂÃÂ      Talking to young girls about IT at local school    What makes us different from other networks?ÃÂÃÂ   There are networks in Sweden that aims to inspire women within IT, for example #addher (created by Sogeti) and Sigma Smart Women Society (created by Sigma). Unlike these networks, WiTech is not bound to any company which makes this network open for everyone and takes away boundaries that some might feel towards other companies.ÃÂÃÂ   WiTech brings women from higher education establishments together with companies and public sector. This reduces the gap between the public and private sector in VÃÂÃÂ¤xjÃÂÃÂ¶/Kalmar. It also gives female students a great opportunity to meet and get inspired by women in the IT-industry, but also future work opportunities.ÃÂÃÂ   The agenda and the goals are created by the women in the network. The women in WiTech are building this network together because they see a need for it. This network is created with the leading words:   By us for us.       Work group of students from different higher educations studies        Risks and challenges  One risk is that when the hype about the network settles in the region, there will be less involvement from the women within the activities and the network will die out. The most important thing to prevent this is to get as many of the women in the network as possibly to be actively involved in planning and implementing activities. By working strongly with social media, we are showing all the good things we do and how we are making changes, this creates motivation for the need of the network. We also want to keep having events for the women to attend. We have been asked to expand the network into other regions in Sweden, we really want this for the future but first we need to build a strong platform in VÃÂÃÂ¤xjÃÂÃÂ¶/Kalmar. Over time we can grow and expand and this will hopefully create a strong brand to connect with.   Another risk is to not get through to the girls at schools and that one of our target groups does not attend our events for them due to prejudices. We have been working hard to start cooperation with the different schools in VÃÂÃÂ¤xjÃÂÃÂ¶/Kalmar. Many schools have been positive to our network and what we do. We have been invited to lecture at some of the schools. But it has still been difficulties to reach the girls to attend event created for them that are not a part of their regular education or mandatory. We have now decided to invite the girls who have shown interest to become student ambassadors at the schools. This will help us with marketing of the events and to reach out to the social channels the girls are using. This will also be a great opportunity for the student ambassador to get to know and get mentors from a lot of business women and researchers in the region.  Since the work being done now is based on volunteering, there is a risk the same people doing everything and that the work load becoming overwhelming to handle after normal working hours. Plans of a steering group have been made and this will help dividing the work among a larger group of women. One task is to decide how the network can move forward and who will work with what. The steering group will decided if there is a need to get a project manager and how that would be financed."

Saves your time!ÃÂÃÂ    Support this project to make Data Boss v2.5 a reality, and get this awesome software for the unbelievable low price right now while you can!ÃÂÃÂ        I wanted to find my photo of Secretary of State John Kerry by the Rodgers Theatre in NYC. All I remembered was that I took it a couple years ago.  And yet, see the result. Above is a screen capture of me finding that photo super fast.ÃÂÃÂ   The only way I could achieve that is because I used Data Boss.  And you can do the same with the further improved, easy-to-use Data Boss version v2.5 - just pledge for this project now!       We've made Data Boss (alpha) back in the Year 2014 for use in our own company because  nothing else like that existed  - yet we needed a  simple yet effective  data management solution for our photo/video business. Badly needed it. And Data Boss did solve our problem, that's why we are confident  you'll love it too !ÃÂÃÂ   WORKS ON ANY PC  Tablet (even cheap ones, $70 or so), laptop, a desktop running Windows (version 7, 8, 10). Any computer will do, even the old one with a weak video card and a low-resolution display is fine. Unlike other software, we are not picky! ÃÂÃÂ   This is a Windows-native software. Works great on either 32-bit or 64-bit systems. ÃÂÃÂ   Very fast, easy installation/uninstallation. Confident, error-free operation - remove human errors by using this specialized software, and get perfect results every time. ÃÂÃÂ   If you have a Mac, then you'll need to run Windows under the emulator (like VMware Fusion or similar) for Data Boss to work.  Data Boss works in-studio or on-location. We know because that's how we use it! (Full specifications below.)ÃÂÃÂ   Being in the photography and videography business for over 17 years, we were always searching for a workable solution. Having tried - unsuccessfully - some other data management systems, we finally were forced to create Data Boss for ourselves.ÃÂÃÂ   We have successfully raised funds for Data Boss v2 here on Kickstarter! Now it's time for even more sophisticated version 2.5, which is this project.ÃÂÃÂ   Pledge now -  save money  and help to advance the  technology you will benefit from !       We'd like to release the  upgraded and further improved Data Boss v2.5  to you. Please support this project - you will benefit immensely!ÃÂÃÂ   This isn't the first time we wrote our own custom software to fulfill a specific need. As far back as the year 1999, we've received a $1,000  Microsoft Award for excellence in programming . Our previous hit software, RAW 4 PRO (also funded here on Kickstarter!) has been enjoying  FIVE STAR user rating  on Amazon and other sites for a couple years now. It is a go-to tool for people in the need of the RAW DNG or JPG sequences to HD Video conversion.

Electronics is something IÃÂÃÂ´m truly passionate about which is why I want to share some of my projects with you.,1.0,2018-01-05 12:00:52 -0500,Backed 0 projects,KO,13,"The idÃÂÃÂ©a!  I have built many different flashlights over the years but this has to be the ultimate. The plan was to build a really bright flashlight that also looked cool. After playing around with the high power LED:s I was planning on using, I quickly realized that air cooling just wasnÃÂÃÂ´t enough, so this is what I came up with! This Liquid Cooled 50W Flashlight produces enough light for all of your lighting needs while looking awesome at the same time.   Features    Liquid Cooled  No problems with overheating  Wide beam angle (around 160 degrees)  Around 2000 lumens of cool light  Unique design   Finished Product     View from the side of the finished product. Here you can see the fan that is connected to the radiator.       View from the other side. Battery is mounted with velcro for easy removal.       View from the front. The two 30W LED:s with the liquid tank in the middle.       A view of the whole flashlight.    Specifications       Tests  The images below show what this flashlight is capable of. These were all shot with the battery fully charged but with no reflectors or focusing lenses on the LED:s.     A test lighting up a radio tower.       A test lighting up a completely dark tunnel.       Lighting up another tunnel.    Improvements  All the money from this campaign will go directly to improving the design and functionality of this flashlight. This includes buying reflectors and focusing lenses for the LED:s in order to get a more uniformed and focused light beam as well as investing in higher capacity batteries for longer battery life.ÃÂÃÂ   I am also planning on buying materials in order to 3D print a nicely designed snap-on handle for a more comfortable grip. If all goes well, I will hopefully be able to make these improvements and bring this flashlight to market in the near future.ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  I have done all i can in order to minimize the risks of this project. I already have a good collection of the needed components in order to fulfill the rewards. The design has been finalized and there has been no problems or needed improvements during testing, the last few weeks.  The biggest risk that, unfortunately, is out of my control is shipping delays of the materials. Therefore, I have taken these delays into consideration when planning my production and delivery schedule. However, I guarantee to keep you updated if any drawbacks would occur."

The study will start 30 days after the campaign has ended.  Forecasting Risk  Though we have learned a great deal from finalizing our Core XT 46 manufacturing and have partnered with some of the best companies, our forecast may not hit its projected timeframe. If we miss a timeline, we will inform you of the circumstances and resolve the issue as quickly as possible.  Supply Chain Risks  In Manufacturing there are unexpected delays that can develop as supply or component shortages, fortunately we have a staff that has a great deal of experience in manufacturing. If a timeline is delayed we will update all backers and resolve the issue as quickly as possible.  Terms and Conditions  Backers with international addresses, who elect to pre-pay their shipping, duties and taxes will have their rewards fulfilled by our Freight agent or international partners, acting as our undisclosed agent on our behalf for distribution of our products when backed via Kickstarter and shipped to an international address. Eu and Uk backers will have units shipped from our EU warehouse, reducing shipping cost.  Between 2004 - 2008 the company product had a name change from Ab-1 to Core 46."

Barking up the review tree  TheÃÂÃÂ  PurpleÃÂÃÂ® Pet Bed was tested by animals. Here's what they had to say (Biscuit let us borrow his translator).       ÃÂÃÂ PurpleÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s place in the animal kingdom  The PurpleÃÂÃÂ® Pet Bed is an amazing fit for any land-lubbing vertebrate who craves a comfy place to rest their haunches. Early birds and night owls, spring chickens and old souls, all-day loungers and active adventurers ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> Purple is perfect for every critter.       ÃÂÃÂ Why Kickstarter...again?  Kickstarter is where Purple got off to an incredible start and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re so excited to honor those roots. Our mission is to bring comfort to all, whether two-legged or four, and we owe a great deal of our success so far to the help of our incredible backers.  Our relationship with Kickstarter began late 2015 when we launched the PurpleÃÂÃÂ® Mattress, and grew even stronger in 2016 with the launch of our  PurpleÃÂÃÂ® Pillow . The camaraderie of the Kickstarter community and the shared excitement of the new and the creative is simply astounding. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s what inspires us to continuously innovate, so itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s only fitting that we give you all the first opportunity to experience PurpleÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s new pet project.       To our loyal backers, whether youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve been with us from the very beginning, you hopped on board with the pillows, or youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve found on Kickstarter for the first time here, thank you. A million times, thank you!ÃÂÃÂ   History of Purple  In 1989, two brothers, engineers Tony and Terry Pearce, partnered to change the world. TonyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s 13 years of experience in advanced aerospace materials, and TerryÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s 20 years of experience in manufacturing, design, and project management led to a partnership creating high-tech carbon fiber sporting goods and wheelchairs.       The Pearce brothers created technology that was used in products by Nike, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Hill-Rom. Eventually, the Pearces set out to create a technology that could revolutionize cushioning at a much lower cost. Purple began to evolve through a series of discoveries and product developments. The first breakthrough came in 1996 when the Pearces invented Hyper-Elastic PolymerÃÂÃÂ®.  This amazingly soft, yet strong material could stretch 15 times its resting size, was uber-durable, and never took a body impression. The key discovery came when Hyper-Elastic PolymerÃÂÃÂ® was molded into the Smart Comfort GridÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢, a structure that could ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>relaxÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ under pressure points, redistributing the pressure to other areas. The same feature turned out to give amazing back support in mattresses.  Three years ago, the Pearces set out to combine all their knowledge of cushioning into the worldÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s best mattress. The Pearce brothers custom designed and built machinery to make Hyper-Elastic PolymerÃÂÃÂ® in the USA at production rates that allowed them to significantly cut the cost of this miracle material to consumers.  Finally, in 2015, The PurpleÃÂÃÂ® Bed was born! Just as the Pearce brothers dreamed it would be ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094> better than any $5000 mattress and costs significantly less. That was the goal, and Purple achieved it!  Why Purple? Well, why not? It is an awesome color, and it signifies treating everyone like royalty. The Pearces have spent most of their high-tech careers advancing the world of cushioning. With the PurpleÃÂÃÂ® Bed, pillow, Platform and adjustable foundations, sheets, mattress protector, and now theÃÂÃÂ PurpleÃÂÃÂ® Pet Bed, they have put all theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve learned into the worldÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s greatest sleep products for both you and your fur baby, and they figured out how to do it so everyone can afford it.ÃÂÃÂ            Risks and challenges  Every Kickstarter endeavor has its risks and challengesÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>you just donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t have many with us! Production has already started. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve built the molds and machinery for our initial launch, and a portion of the money we raise here will go to fund the production of more molds and machinery so we can continue making Purple in the USA at two Utah factories.   Production time will be our biggest challenge, as we make all of the Purple for all of our products at our factory. Another portion of our funding will be used to grow our Purple team to meet production demands.   Another challenge might be working with our product partners to get certain international components to the factory in time to hit delivery deadlines. However, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve worked hard over the last several months to build up these relationships and plan accordingly. We expect to hit all of our delivery promises with the launch of the PurpleÃÂÃÂ® Pet Bed."

Long maintenance periods of 12 months  , so you can keep the diving fun going!                           We did a lot of research on 20 underwater propellers and found out that the products which are under $1,000 are not suitable for recreational use in the ocean. The products that are over $1,000 are designed for professionals, which are too difficult for normal users. So, we designed H2, the only affordable, easy-to-operate, safe and powerful sea scooter for your recreational use.        Most importantly, flying in the ocean is incredibly irresistible.             The wing design provides an easy experience The biggest challenge faced by flat wings is the fact that they are affected by water pressure. In view of this, we not only used strong and powerful ABS materials on this product, but also spent nearly two years on designing and developing this product and finally solved this difficult problem, allowing flat thrusts to dive 20 meters deep.ÃÂÃÂ         Aquajet Dive H2  has been all over the world , from Bohol island in the Philippines to Bali in Indonesia. After over ten test sessions in swimming pool and the ocean internationally,  we got valuable feedback from 70 professional divers and 200 normal users.

Our patented magnet mechanism makes quick and simple release of the foot from the pedal possible at any time. In comparison to standard click in pedals the risk of crash and injury will be reduced to a minimum ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> and your head stays free for a hassle free biking experience without fear.  We need your support to get the pedal into mass production.   Das magped Sicherheitspedal ist die Pedal-Innovation fÃÂÃÂ¼r Mountainbikes und E-Bikes. Durch den Einsatz unseres patentierten Magnetmechanismus ist ein sicheres, schnelles und einfaches AblÃÂÃÂ¶sen des FuÃÂ<U+009F>es vom Pedal jederzeit mÃÂÃÂ¶glich. Das Sturz- und Verletzungsrisiko wird im Vergleich zu Pedalen mit festen Verbindungen (z.B. Klickpedalsystem) auf ein absolutes Minimum reduziert - und der Kopf bleibt frei fÃÂÃÂ¼r genussvolles Biken ohne Angst.    Wir benÃÂÃÂ¶tigen Deine UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzung, um das Pedal in die Massenproduktion zu bringen.      magped :: magnetic safety bike pedals       Pulling Force    Depending on your choice of pedal the magnet will connect you up to approx. 15 kg in pulling force. The force deploys primarily in a downward force and therefore a quick and simple release with a sideways move of your foot is possible practically without effort. But even in more critical situations the pulling force can be overcome without difficulties in a vertical direction as well.   Der Schuh wird je nach gewÃÂÃÂ¤hlter MagnetstÃÂÃÂ¤rke mit bis zu 15 kg Zugraft magnetisch am Pedal gehalten. Die Zugkraft wirkt vor allem vertikal und ein seitliches AblÃÂÃÂ¶sen vom Pedal ist nahezu ohne spÃÂÃÂ¼rbaren Widerstand mÃÂÃÂ¶glich. Aber auch ein schnelles und einfaches AblÃÂÃÂ¶sen in kritischen Situationen direkt nach oben ist kein Problem.      Positioning    The pedal allows for several degrees of twist of your foot and therefore provides less strain on your ankles during your rides. In addition the foot position can be varied to the front or back without a loss of pulling force for an ideal position on your ascend and your descend.   Das Pedal ermÃÂÃÂ¶glicht eine geringfÃÂÃÂ¼gige Drehung des Schuhs und schont somit die Gelenke beim Treten. Ebenso lÃÂÃÂ¤sst sich die Position nach vorne und hinten ohne VerÃÂÃÂ¤nderung der Zugkraft variieren, damit findet sich sowohl fÃÂÃÂ¼r den Aufstieg wie auch fÃÂÃÂ¼r die Abfahrt leicht die ideale Position.      Shoe plate    The shoe plate is made of anti corrosion treated steel and it is compatible with all SPD bike shoes. The shoe plate can be mounted very easily within a few minutes with 2 screws. In comparison to other systems the magped pedal is insensitive to dirt. Additionally the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>walkabilityÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ of your bike shoe will be significantly improved.   Die Schuhplatte aus rostbehandeltem Spezialstahl kann auf jeden SPD-kompatiblen Fahrradschuh mit 2 Schrauben in wenigen Minuten montiert werden. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Systemen ist Schmutz fÃÂÃÂ¼r das magped kein Problem. ZusÃÂÃÂ¤tzlich wird die Stolpergefahr beim Gehen reduziert und der Gehkomfort stark verbessert.      Circular motion    The magped pedal ensures a continuous circular tread by employing your extensor muscles (70%) as well as your flexor muscles (30%) for maximum riding performance. You will feel the difference especially on longer rides.   Das magped Pedal ermÃÂÃÂ¶glicht einen runden Tritt, da sowohl die Muskel - Strecker (70%) wie auch die Muskel - Beuger (30%) der Beinmuskulatur gleichmÃÂÃÂ¤ÃÂ<U+009F>ig beansprucht werden. So werden auch lÃÂÃÂ¤ngere Bike Touren zum reinen VergnÃÂÃÂ¼gen.      Technology    The magped pedal is equipped with 3 sealed high quality industrial type bearings. Pins can be exchanged if required. The high performance neodymium magnet is adjustable by means of an integrated polymer damper unit.   Das magped Pedal ist mit 3 hochwertigen, abgedichteten Industriekugellagern ausgestattet. Die Pins des Pedals kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen bei Bedarf gewechselt werden. Die HÃÂÃÂ¶he des Neodym Hochleistungsmagneten ist ÃÂÃÂ¼ber eine spezielle integrierte Polymerfederung verstellbar.      Weight    The magped pedal is a modern high quality flat pedal made from light CNC cut aluminium with a CrMo spindle. The weight including our patented magnetic system is only 452 grams (100N magnet) or 474 grams (150N magnet) per pair.ÃÂÃÂ    Das magped Pedal ist ein modernes und hochwertiges Flat Pedal aus leichtem CNC gefrÃÂÃÂ¤sten Aluminium, und einer CrMo Spindel. Das Gewicht inklusive unserem patentierten Magnetsystem betrÃÂÃÂ¤gt nur 452g (100N Magnet) bzw. 474g (150N Magnet) pro Paar.       Risks and challenges  We built a lot of prototypes in the last 2 years to come to a final working design. The most difficult feature to realize was that the magnet has the be adjustable in hight, flexible mounted and the whole mechanism had to be resistant against dirt.  Wir haben in den letzten 2 Jahren sehr viele Prototypen gebaut, bis wir zum funktionierenden Design gekommen sind. Die grÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂ<U+009F>te Schwierigkeit war den Magnet so einzubauen, dass er in der HÃÂÃÂ¶he verstellbar ist, sowie flexibel gelagert sein muss. ZusÃÂÃÂ¤tzlich sollte die gesamte Konstruktion schmutzresistent sein."

They are the pros and enthusiasts at Peguino.  There are some real challenges:  One is the production of highly precise parts of plastic which have to fit neatly into the industrial standard brick world. Plus house all the additional hardware parts from the ArduinoÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ world. These parts are made usually from many different suppliers and they vary in size, shape and in the wide range of different electronic components ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> often fail to fit precisely in the size as they are specified in the data sheets. As a result, some hidden challenges may appear and it could take some days to override them. The manufacturing pathway from prototypes to final parts is often long and complex. All prototypes are in a usable stage and carefully crafted. They are mainly made on high precision industry grade 3D printers ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> which guarantee the best results. The straight pathway from prototype to the final product is possible in nearly one production step.

These pledges will be added on top of the Kickstarter amount raised! With 6 hours to go, we are almost at the 22K Gold Plated Stretch Goal!  Update 4th of April:ÃÂÃÂ    Just got off the phone with the manufacturer and things are looking good. They are working on the coin dies as we speak and we can expect the first ever physical coin at the end of the next week! :)   Once the test coin looks good, then we can place our order and start production! :)  DeepOnion members can now back this project, using Onions (DeepOnion cryptocurrency) via a simple website I made. These pledges will be added   on top   of the Kickstarter goal at the end of the Kickstarter campaign.  DeepOnion Physical Coins  Welcome everyone to my first Kickstarter campaign! Back in October 2017, I came across a rather unique and awesome cryptocurrency project called; DeepOnion. This 8 month old, but very fast growing cryptocurrency project, isÃÂÃÂ an anonymous cryptocurrency that is natively integrated with the TOR network. Thousands of new members are joining their official forums every month!  You will find more information via their official website:ÃÂÃÂ  https://deeponion.org   A couple weeks ago I shared my idea with the community for the physical DeepOnion Coins, to see whether there were more enthusiasts just like me that thought it would be a good idea as well! The feedback was amazing and in the following weeks, the community made designs and voted for the best one.ÃÂÃÂ   Coin Details  In order to make every coin 100% unique and a true collectors item, all coins will be numbered (laser engraved), the date and ""Batch 1 #"" will be minted on the coin and there will be a cap of 2500 coins to be minted. The one hundred 22K Gold plated stretch goal coins will have the numbers 1-100.   Size &amp; WeightÃÂÃÂ  Each coin will be 3cm (1.18 Inches) in diameter, and 2mm (.08 Inches) thick. The weight of each coin is roughly 11 Grams (0.39 oz). They have roughly the same size and weight of half a dollar coin.   Material  Heavyweight alloy comprised of 63%ÃÂÃÂ Copper and 37% Zinc with a nickel coating, giving it a gold color, making itÃÂÃÂ scratch resistant, non-tarnishing and very durable.  The limited edition ""Golden"" stretch goal Coins are made of the same materials, but with 22 karat Gold plating.  Each coin will have ridged edges, and a glossy finish.   Shipping  All orders will be shipped with priority shipping from The Netherlands, using extra protective bubble envelopes/mailers. Track and Trace is provided for pledges of 25 coins or more. Depending on where you live, shipping roughly takesÃÂÃÂ between 2-14-working days, and does not include any delays with customs.  Stretch Goals     Free One Hundred 22K Gold Plated Coins     ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ 7,500 - UNLOCKED!! ÃÂÃÂ - All coins will be delivered in  plastic coin capsules ÃÂÃÂ preventing coins from becoming damaged by protecting it from outside contaminants while allowing the coin to be viewed through transparent plastic.ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ 10,000 - UNLOCKED!! ÃÂÃÂ -ÃÂÃÂ The first 100 backers of this campaign (that pledge for at least 10 coins) receive  1 FREE  Limited Edition 2018 "" 22 Karat Gold plated "" Coin. These coins will have the numbers 1-100, and they will never be minted again, making them highly collectible!   ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ 15,000 - Locked  - All 5 &amp; 10 Coin Backers receive  1 FREE additional  coin to their order. All 25 Coins and more Backers receive  2 FREE additional ÃÂÃÂ coins to their order.   ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ 25,000 - Locked  - Free Mystery Gift Included with every pledge!  ÃÂÃÂ  Timeline       This is a rough estimation on how long everything will take. I will make sure that the coin die will be made as soon as we hit the main funding goal, in order to start production as soon as possible. It is more likely production will take roughly 3 weeks when the manufacturers planning allows this. I will do my best to speed up the process.  *All orders will be send with priority shipping from The Netherlands. Depending on where you live, it takes roughly between two and fourteen working days to get delivered to you. This can take longer when hold by customs.ÃÂÃÂ   Share This Project  I could use any help I can get in spreading the word about this campaign, plus chances get higher that we will meet a stretch goal and additional rewards get unlocked, so please click on the share button on the top of this page to tell your friends all about these awesome coins or share this link:ÃÂÃÂ https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/327018978/mint-deeponion-physical-coins   Disclaimer   The final design and production of the coin may be different to the illustration photo presented on this page. Based on manufacturing capabilities, the fine details such as the anonymous mask may be larger/different. This DeepOnion coin is a novelty item which is not made out of gold. Pledges of 10 coins or less will be send with priority, but without track and trace. I am not responsible for lost or delayed shipments.  This DeepOnion Coin is a novelty item and does not have any monetary value. There is no QR code, wallet address and/or chip on the coin.      Risks and challenges  This is my first Kickstarter Campaign, so over the past few weeks I have been working hard to think of everything to make sure that this project will succeed and that the risks or challenges are brought to a minimum.   I am working directly with the manufacturer that will produce the coin. I visited them earlier to discuss the possibilities in regards to the design, production time and materials being used.  That being said, the biggest risk we face is not getting funded, so don't let that happen! After you make your pledge to get some of these awesome coins, help spread the word! Share the link to this campaign with friends and on your social media accounts."

ÃÂÃÂ   Most people will soon be adding another thing to this ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>what ifÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ list ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093>  one that could be just as transformative as any of those. ÃÂÃÂ    That thing? Blockchain. ÃÂÃÂ   Right now, the closest many get to knowing this technology is through Bitcoin. But in industries, economies and technologies, the focus is on Blockchain - and how those organizations position, adapt or evolve themselves to take advantage of this revolutionary break-through.  The majority of people donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t know about Blockchain yet. But soon, everything will change...       You may not realize it yet, but weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re at the beginning of another frontier era. ÃÂÃÂ   Just like the Internet did at the start of this century, Blockchain is creating a new ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Wild WestÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s an untamed land, where opportunity and success wait for those brave enough to discover it. ÃÂÃÂ   Right now, pioneers are moving to stake their claim in this barely discovered territory.ÃÂÃÂ And as they push towards that rich country, their carts (and minds) are filled with the one thing needed to make the journey a success.    Education. ÃÂÃÂ    With education, these Blockchain pioneers will shape society and leave their mark. For those who learn, harness and use this new technology, the opportunities are endless: ÃÂÃÂ    Joining companies like IBM or Microsoft, desperately looking for the skills you possess to drive the next generation of innovative ideas  Utilizing the technology for yourself as a digital entrepreneur, creating disruptors that cut out middlemen and topple outdated business models  Learning the secrets of cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) to help frame your investment decisions  Taking action to understand a technology thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s driving the world deep into the 21st century   As one of the rare pioneers who truly understands and can use Blockchain, you hold the map to all of these opportunities - and more.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        So how do you become a Blockchain pioneer?  Most importantly, you have to be interested, if not fascinated, with Blockchain. Technologies come and go, but only a few really revolutionize the world. ÃÂÃÂ   If youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re reading this, you already possess this crucial trait. ÃÂÃÂ   But you also need practical skills. And theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re not as simple to gain as reading up on Bitcoin or watching a few YouTube videos. To make your way into the world of Blockchain, you need to build the ENTIRE skillset. ÃÂÃÂ         ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s what our course will help you achieve. ÃÂÃÂ    WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re passionate about shining a light onto leading technologies. Blockchain is a perfect example. ÃÂÃÂ   But weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve chosen it as our next ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>deep diveÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ for another big reason: YOU. The demand to learn this technology has been overwhelming! Thousands of tech-savvy people already realize the mind-blowing potential of Blockchain.  TheyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re determined to be amongst the pioneers of this exciting, uncharted field. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s what weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re planning to help them become.  We've already helped thousands gain skills in other cutting-edge technology: our Deep Learning A-Z and Artificial Intelligence A-Z courses both ranked in the top 10 on Kickstarter.  To date, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve launched three mega-successful campaigns with over 4,000 backers, all hungry for the knowledge and opportunity these skills supplied them.  Now weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re ready to take on the awesome challenge of uncovering the secrets to mastering Blockchain.       ÃÂÃÂ         A Blockchain ÃÂÃÂ is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp and transaction data.ÃÂÃÂ    Bitcoin  is the most famous application of Blockchain, it is the first decentralized digital currency and aÃÂÃÂ peer-to-peer payment system, meaning that its transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary.  Those definitions are a great start. But that's all they are - a start. It took us over 2 months of continuous research on Blockchain technology to truly understand how it works. And only after that we were ready to create.  And now we want to put all our knowledge together, optimize it into easy-to-digest tutorials and share it with you. We want to help you avoid all the pitfalls and obstacles that we encountered in our paths.  Blockchain is going to disrupt the World. We're all going to be part of it and our mission is to guide you along the best path to success with this technology.       This course will have two pillars: intuition and practice.ÃÂÃÂ   With the intuition tutorials (which we expect to comprise hours of content) you will be able to develop a holistic understanding Blockchain technology regardless of your starting level. If you're an tech veteran, beginner or have never heard of blockchain before (which is unlikely) - you  will  be successful with this course.  And for those of you who want to dive into the World of coding, there's the second pillar: Practice. Everyone loves practice. And that's exactly why in this course we will build not one, not two - but  three  applications: a  Blockchain , a  Cryptocurrency , and a  Smart Contract .ÃÂÃÂ   We will create everything absolutely from scratch, step-by-step which will give you the opportunity of getting into the right mindset of creation.ÃÂÃÂ   We will build our Blockchain and Cryptocurrency in  Python  and the Smart Contract on  Ethereum  using  Solidity . We will show you how to get the right logic of coding and how to get into the right mindset.ÃÂÃÂ   And on top of all of that, we're even going to launch our own simulated  Initial Coin Offering (ICO).        And if you want to tackle the 2nd Pillar of this Course (Practice), you will also learn and get to use many of the most powerful tools which are part of the Blockchain World:   JSON -ÃÂÃÂ  stands for JavaScript Object Notation and itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a data format;ÃÂÃÂ    Ganache - ÃÂÃÂ allows to fire up a personal Ethereum blockchain which you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates;   Postman - ÃÂÃÂ the most complete toolchain for API development;   MyEtherWallet -  an open source tool for generating Ethererum Wallets &amp; sending transactions;   Remix -  the most popular and user-friendly Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Solidity;   Anaconda -  an open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment;   Flask -ÃÂÃÂ  a micro web development framework for Python;   Spyder -  a powerful Python IDE with advanced editing and features;  Once you know how to use these tools, you can construct Blockchains and the supporting infrastructure for anything. ÃÂÃÂ   Like what, you ask? ÃÂÃÂ   Well, try ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦ ÃÂÃÂ    A trusted mechanism that tracks and protects hard valuables like diamonds  A way for neighbors to sell excess solar energy to each other - with no intermediary taking a ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>cutÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ  The means to manage swarms of decentralized, autonomous robotic workers in the near-future  Your passport, birth certificate, ID ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> any document thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s part of your identity ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> kept safely and securely in the digital world  ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>LinkedIn on the BlockchainÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> a way to store  verified  career and academic achievements that both professionals and employers can trustÃÂÃÂ     When you hold the power, your choices are limitless.        When we say youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll get a comprehensive course that provides everything you need to build a blockchain, we mean it.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Can you get all of these topics on YouTube or elsewhere online? Sure you can... But what you won't get is the weeks and months of work we're putting into this course to link these topics up into a  holistic understanding  of Blockchain.ÃÂÃÂ   The structure of Blockchain A-ZÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ will include three modules. And each module will be so detailed and thorough, that youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll practically be getting three COURSES which extend your knowledge and skills far beyond just building a Blockchain.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   To create your Blockchain, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be leveraging the power of Python and its rich libraries. But donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t worry if youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re not familiar with it. Python is an easy, expressive language that youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll pick up quickly, and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be there to guide you every step of the way.

ÃÂÃÂ    ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s great you donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t need complex math or programming, but isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t this just too simple? ÃÂÃÂ    Blockchain, at its lowest level, is just code. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s what weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re guiding you on how to develop (along with the mindset behind that). Math and sophisticated encryption are handled by Python libraries, which allows you to purely focus on the critical ideas behind Blockchain itself. ÃÂÃÂ    Wait. Hold on. Are we going to be creating a real, proper Blockchain?  ÃÂÃÂ   Yes, thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s exactly what weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re doing. In this course you  will ÃÂÃÂ create a Blockchain exactly like the ones used in the real world. ÃÂÃÂ    IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen other courses charge for a certificate, is this the same? ÃÂÃÂ    Others might do this, but we believe if youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve learned the skills, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve earned the right to a certificate that says so. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why you pay nothing more for your certificate of completion when you finish. Use it to prove yourself to potential employers, build on your business credentials or simply show it off to friends. ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be on hand to support you along your entire journey!       See what other students just like you are saying about our recent best-selling courses:       ÃÂÃÂ        Upon completion of this course youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll get a verifiable electronic certificate which you can use to boost business credentials, increase the chances of landing that dream job in tech or simply show off to your connections on Linkedin (the actual design will differ):       ÃÂÃÂ        Blockchain wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t be a revolutionary technology forever. Pioneers, already educated in utilizing it, are making territorial claims in this opportunity-rich technology at this very moment. ÃÂÃÂ   We canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t wait to make this course a reality, and help you harness the power of blockchain. Are you ready to join those exclusive ranks and leverage this technology for your own goals?  To Blockchain!ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   -Kirill and Hadelin       ÃÂÃÂ      Get Your Project Funded Today!

Some of the major ones include: sourcing the right equipment, learning to produce clear and engaging tutorials, finding what exactly interests our students, having the appropriate level of subject matter expertise.  Having built up a substantial level of expertise in the space of online education we are confident that we are well-equipped to face any challenges: we have tried and tested equipment including backup hardware and software; between the two of us we have already produced over 30 courses with hundreds of hours of content and over a thousand tutorials enabling us to develop our unique engaging teaching styles; we constantly interact with our existing 400,000+ students including Q&amp;A, webinars and surveys - this allows us to know exactly what common painpoints we need to address in the course content; and finally, we do have extensive backgrounds in Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence but we are constantly doing research and deepening our own knowledge to make sure we can deliver the best of the best to our students in Blockchain A-Z."

MORROR provides appropriate lighting and is pre-installed with makeup and skincare tutorials that will level up your daily beauty routine.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        MORROR is a makeup mirror redefined. Press the button to wake up the display and watch the tutorials. Press again to turn it off so it wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t be disturbing when you donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t need it.  Traditional mirrors with built-in screens still show the black shade of the screen even when itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s off. MORROR is not one of them. The smart display in MORROR only appears when you wake it up. MORROR is the real magic mirror on your vanity.       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Looking back and forth from your vanity mirror to your smartphone/tablet for makeup tutorial? No anymore! With MORROR, you can easily follow the step-by-step makeup instructions right from your mirror.  Having a facial massage every day is an easy thing to do with MORROR.

ÃÂÃÂ        Wondering why you always donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t get the perfect makeup? You might want to check your makeup lighting. Light is very important for makeup application. Good makeup light illuminates your face just right to help you make the right choice of the color for your foundation, eyeshadow, blush, lipstick and so on.  While natural sunlight is the best light to apply makeup, we are not able to make the best use of it because of bad weathers, short days, tall buildings, and etc.  To solve this problem, we created the Pro-lux light system to simulate natural sunlight.       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ   Pro-lux light system closely simulates natural sunlightÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s full-color spectrum. It is made of 38 LED lights and a smart chip.

We estimate we'll begin shipping in May, accounting both for manufacturing and any necessary revisions.  We don't anticipate any issues with this timeline. However, if anything unexpected happens, we promise to keep you informed, both during and after the campaign."

Purpose and goals of the Ottawa Sparks Street Streetcar Project:  (Also check our Facebook Page!)  To plan, build and operate a heritage style streetcar system in Downtown Ottawa.  Modern Replica Streetcars that have the appearance of heritage streetcars would be used for the system. These streetcars would have modern components and be handicapped accessible via wheelchair lifts.  The system would be a single track system with passing tracks in several sections.   PhaseÃÂÃÂ One  would run from Sparks and Elgin to the area of the War Museum.   PhaseÃÂÃÂ Two  would cross the Ottawa River and run through Gatineau and then cross back into Ottawa to connect back to Sparks Street to form a cross-river loop system.  The initial system would comprise two operating streetcars with one spare streetcar. They would be stored in a garage large enough for several additional streetcars and there would be several maintenance bays included in the design.

After sucessfully launching Raspiboy on Kickstarter last year, 8BCraft is proud to present you            ÃÂÃÂ RetroGaming is constantly gaining in popularity, especially with the developments of single boards computer (raspberry pi, orange pi...) that enabled us to make homemad retrogaming consoles. However those required lot of knowhow on electronics and DIY. You may have seen ""Gameboyzero"" projects on internet and understand how difficult assembling one can be!  First with Raspiboy I wanted to simplify things for you guys by making an easy kit with no soldering. But now I want to go even further by making RetroStone whichÃÂÃÂ come  fully assembled !       HDMI output : you can connect RetroStone to your big TV !ÃÂÃÂ        4 USB connectorsÃÂÃÂ        Play up to 5 players !ÃÂÃÂ        Take RetroStone everywhere with it's compact form factor! No more boring flights for you!       Audio control       ÃÂÃÂ Gamepad controls       Back button configuration has been voted to change (lot of people just complained about it!) I posted new design on ""Update 1"" of the Kickstarter to ask backers to vote and lot of people vote for new design. New design is this one :ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ Prototype has been received and confirmed!       Also back buttons color will be voted by the backers after campaign!ÃÂÃÂ                  Inside you have a RetroStone Pi, this SBC (single board computer) runs a  H3 processor  which is  4 cores 1.2GHz .ÃÂÃÂ                  Basic RetroStone will come with 8GB SD card, which can already hold hundred of games.   Upgrade from 8GB to 16GB memory for FREE  by sharing RetroStone kickstarter on facebook!  Copy the URL of your facebook post and save it for later.At the end of the Kickstarter I will send you a survey for shipping details, there you will be able to put your URL to get the free memory card upgrade!             But wait! You are saying that we can play any game of our childhood, what does it mean exactly? Does the kit comes with games integrated?ÃÂÃÂ    Software  : Retrostone Pi is compatible with Retrorangepi (Retropie distribution for H3 boards). Retropie is anÃÂÃÂ awesome emulation station software (super easy installation, it will be explained step-by-step in the tutorial!).ÃÂÃÂ You can check them on Youtube for demo !Those softwares come with a wide range of systems supported : Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, Super Nintendo, Megadrive/Genesis, Atari, MaMe and so on. You can have a look  here  to all the supported systems.  RetroStone Pi is also compatible with most other H3 SBC OS (armbian, android...).  Please note that the software will not be pre-installed because these are open-source softwares and their license forbide it.   Games  : To install a game you need it's ROM file. A ROM file is a computer file containing all the game's data. You can legally download ROM of unlicensed games on the internet. For licensed games legality of downloading ROM depend on your country. In some you need to have original copy of the game. In some others it may not be legal at all to download ROMs from internet.  Then to install the ROM you can transfer it with USB stick to RetroStone.   Develop your own game, share them and discover other RetroStone user's games !ÃÂÃÂ    I think there's a lot of potential to develop and share your games! A topic will be opened on the forum about game idea, development and sharing.            Joining me on kickstarter is not only about getting a nice game console. It's also about the journey of the project! As you can check on my first Kickstarter campaign RaspiboyÃÂÃÂ I made a point to give good updates (check for yourself  HERE ). With interesting facts on production.ÃÂÃÂ   Here are exemples of what people thought of them!            The main advantages of RetroStone compared with Raspiboy are :ÃÂÃÂ   - Easy memory card access  - Assembled and fully tested  - Compact form factor  - More powerful CPU  - Ethernet, more USB connectors and full size HDMI       ÃÂÃÂ Size comparaison of RetroStone and Raspiboy            By connecting a screen, keyboard and mouse, your console becomes the perfect living room computer. Write a novel, surf YouTube or watch your movies on your big screen while kicking back on your couch.                      ÃÂÃÂ If you really like the project don't hesitate to get the Kickstarter Limited Edition!ÃÂÃÂ   Limited edition will come with  32GB  instead of 8GB (or 16GB if you do the free upgrade)  Limited edition will be  CLEAR BLUE color . I can't have picture of RetroStone with clear case because we need the injection mold for that!!ÃÂÃÂ   So to illustrate here's a picture of the Raspiboy casing with such a clear case.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ But it will be blue rather than purple. Bit like this :ÃÂÃÂ        This limited edition will be available only on Kickstarter, so don't miss it ;)       Makers I have not forgotten you! RetroStone may come assembled but we left room for customization!  RetroStone has 26 GPIO available, with built-in pull up resistors            4 of those GPIO have optional buttons built-in the RetroStone Pi       And casing has layout for those optional buttons! So you just have to drill the buttons holes to add those buttons.            ÃÂÃÂ EnergySquare is an innovative wireless charger. RetroStone embedded their charging system! (You can still charge with micro-USB of course!)       ÃÂÃÂ With the two contact pins it charges by contact directly, so it's faster than induction charging.                 That's something I often hear. Lot of kickstarter project are scams and never deliver their promised product. But that is because lot of them are selling ideas that are not ready to industrialize. Sometime you can even see their pictures are just 3D modeling, meaning they don't even have prototypes. Or they can have prototypes that are not ready for industrialized production.ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ As my first Kickstarter campaign can attest I am as transparant as I can be, my prototypes are really ready for production. And I did delivered all my backers!Ok for this first project I had little bit of delays. Now with experience of the first Kickstarter I have a better estimate of deadlines and I am confident to be on timing!       It can be :  ÃÂÃÂ    For yourself to have some good fun with friends. ÃÂÃÂ   To make a gift to a special someone.ÃÂÃÂ   To discover the world of hackerspaces, fablabs and SBC (single board computers).

Or you can use it as additional gamepad control!       In order to accelerate development, as soon as we reach our goal we'll start the mold manufacture.  End of March 2018 : End of crowdfundingÃÂÃÂ     April-May 2018 : Production  June 2018 : Product certifications (CE and FCC certifications)   End of June 2018 : Shipping to you guys!    Additional video to see the LCD closerÃÂÃÂ    Lot of people expressed concerns about LCD quality. So here's a little review on LCD.  H3 has 2 video outputs : HDMI and CVBS (= composite/AV) In order to be able to use RetroStone on a TV we need the HDMI out unused, so I use the AV signal for the 3.5"" LCD.  Some people asked if picture looked better than on Raspiboy. Answer is yes, because on Raspiboy we used overscan to resize the resolution to fit the LCD size, and this resizing makes it flickers quite a bit in emulationstation (also the AV signal goes through pogo pins in Raspiboy, which does not help).  I had trouble making video showing the LCD from close because everytime I tried to shoot a video I ended up with lot of artifacts. Strange lines/patterns appearing. (try to film your computer screen with your smartphone and you'll see it's not easy !). Also when LCD picture goes from clear to dark the camera has trouble adapting luminosity. Anyhow I made a shot that is not so bad.  Please note that there are still some artifacts on the videoÃÂÃÂ such as camera autofocusing.         You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.      Play                                      Replay with sound          Play with   sound                   00:00    00:00                                                 Risks and challenges  Why crowdfunding?   In order to make this kit so affordable we must reach our fundraising goal because:    1- The casing require injection molding. And injection molds are really expensive.    2- PCB : we have to order more than 1000 units if we want to have workable prices. Indeed most of the electronic components of the PCB have minimum order quantities of 1000-5000 pieces!    Therefor we must reach about 1000 orders to make this price possible!  Development is done, everything is ready: 3Dmodels are done, PCB design is done, and manufacturers are ready to get started. The only thing that is missing is a 1000 pieces order! All the project needs now is you guys!  Back us now and help us reach our fundraising goal so that it will become reality !  Remarks :   RetroStone does not come with any software or games pre-installed. You can flash the memory card with the OS of your choice.  RetroStones will ship from ShenZhen in China, to avoid any delivery problems we will declare full value of the products. Please note that there might be taxes applied by your country customs.   Please provide phone number for delivery, failure to do so might prevent delivery to be successful.

Risks and challenges  There is currently an economic crisis in the camp which has led to increase daily running costs for the centre. Students have been missing payments to keep our centre alive due to many organisations closing their business and therefore leading to many refugees losing their main employment source. Additionally, our solar system needs expanding to accomodate the increased power requirements of the centre as more students start to use it. Teachers have also been hard to keep in the long-term, with little pay incentives, we need funds to pay teachers for future semesters."

The first ScienceBuzz Symposium is a step closer toward the right solution.  What is ScienceBuzz Foundation?  ScienceBuzz Foundation, founded and run by high school senior student Roy Ghosh in 2017, revolves around the website ScienceBuzz.com. As a registered nonprofit organization, our mission is to publicize and promote young scientists and their work.     Homepage of ScienceBuzz.com    ScienceBuzz.com is a free academic-networking platform for all middle and high school students interested in science. We connect these students to one another and showcase their original work to scientists, institutions, and industry professionals around the globe. We are uniquely positioned with our partners to provide an outlet for students to build personal, academic profiles, publish their research, discuss new ideas and technologies, interact with peers, and get acknowledged.  Check us out at:  www.sciencebuzz.com       Poster/Pamphlet    Where are we today?  As of today, we have over six hundred published, reviewed articles with more than 6,000 registered users, coming from 22 countries and 48 states.

About theÃÂÃÂ  Founder  Roy Ghosh is a current senior at Parkland High School and has participated in science fairs and research internships for the past six years. He has been an intern at the National Institutes of Health for the past two years, performing research on metastatic cancers and chemotherapeutics. Before then, during middle school and as a freshman, Roy had been an independent researcher at Lehigh UniversityÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s Bionanomechanics Lab. Roy had been personally affected by the lack of a platform to showcase and communicate his work, and thus founded ScienceBuzz to help thousands of other students like him.  He has won several research awards and has been honored at multiple conferences for his work on ScienceBuzz.ÃÂÃÂ He has received the support from several biotech companies and institutions across the nation for ScienceBuzz.ÃÂÃÂ In under a year, he has been an exhibitor and invited speaker at three national conferences.  To Learn More about Roy, visit:ÃÂÃÂ  www.sciencebuzz.com/about-us/   Thank You and Please Share to Get the Word Out!      Risks and challenges  The main purpose of the symposium is to have ""One Day of Powerful Talks."" Therefore, getting internationally-renowned speakers and icons from the scientific world to inspire the students is essential to the success of the event. We have been gathering a series of speakers to overcome this challenge, including a Nobel Prize Laureate, the head of a leading scientific institution, college admissions officers, university professors, leaders in gifted education, and top biopharma executives.  Additionally, our exhibitors and workshop sessions will provide the tools necessary for students to be exposed to all options and career pathways in STEM. We plan to have biopharma companies, national scientific organizations, and gifted programs as the primary exhibitors during the symposium."

I have a background in engineering and grew up in the sunny town of Palo Alto, CA before Facebook and Google put them on the map! I have two kids Abbie and Andrew and they are the inspiration behind emagine A and our products. Good sleep is something the general population is getting less and less of, but I especially relate to the parents. As a Dad of two working in electronics manufacturing, sleep is something that doesn't come by easy. After our second child Andrew was born, I started trying many different sleep products and at the end found that the most simple and effective ended up being a sleep cycle alarm clock app on my phone. It wasn't until then that I realized how big sleep affected my entire well-being. Effective sleep really changed my mood and state of mind not only in the morning, but throughout the day.Fast forward two years, our two kids just started transitioning to a regular schedule of going to pre-school and every morning was a struggle. Either they were up way too early or after trying everything to get them up they needed to be literally dragged from their beds out of the house. As children, their bodies are much more susceptible to outside factors compared to us adults. Think about how you feel in the morning after a bad nights sleep and now think how much worse your children may feel when you get them out of bed. I thought, &quot;If there is so much technology to enhance the lives of the average adult, why not for those who need it more?&quot;.

The technology, which records the brainÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s electrical activity via electrodes on the scalp, can be used to diagnose epilepsy, sleep disorders, diseases like AlzheimerÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s, and other brain-related conditions. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s also used in neurofeedback sessions with ADHD patients, who are trained to increase their beta waves (these signify an attentive state) through audio and video feedback linked to EEG activity.       We will continue to work hard, and of course, whether positive news or not, we will update you early and often. Our entire team is passionate, and want to make a difference in your life through our product.ÃÂÃÂ   Our team is committed to continuously improve the quality of the product, optimize the experience, upgrading the product, so the actual product features, specifications or design may be slightly different, these changes may not be notified, please forgive us! But please be assured that we will only get better!No one can guarantee that there is no problem at all, especially in the complex manufacturing process. We have made two batches of products, and problems are less and less.If there are any delays or issues along the way we will inform you of them and tell you the exact steps we will implement to overcome them.We have overcome the common and un-common hurdles.ÃÂÃÂ   Our boots are already on the ground and we can walk over to the factory on a daily basis if needed.We are certainly up for this challenge and confident that we will tackle it head-on!

We believe Kickstarter will help get our product in front of thousands of potential backers and help fund our first few production runs. Without Kickstarter it is going to be very difficult for us to produce this product at the scale required to turn this into a feasible, long term sustainable business.   Kickstarter has far more organic traffic than other crowdfunding sites and has an extremely loyal base of backers who love supporting campaigns such as ours.ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  We have nearly 1 year experience in delivering speakers across the globe so we have given ourselves plenty of time to ensure backers receive their rewards in a timely fashion. In the unlikely event that we fall behind schedule, we will keep backers updated.  We want our backers to enjoy their speakers for years to come so we are giving a 2 year manufacturers warranty. Our manufacturing factory has a very meticulous quality control team but if your speaker stops working for whatever reason please get in touch and we will find a prompt solution."

After a lifetime of being interested in flashlights as a hobby, I wanted something more. After joining and participating in flashlight forums in 2012, it became apparent that many of the budget friendly flashlights left a lot to be desired.ÃÂÃÂ   After speaking to many flashlight users and experts on the forums, I began a discussion with the aim of improving the function of an existing product. After contacting the original manufacturer here in China, we were able to produce a special Reylight edition of their light with our preferred emitter and user interface.ÃÂÃÂ   Two years later in 2014, I designed and produced my very own flashlight - the  Reylight Titanium Tripple . This light was designed to use the ever-popular 18350 cell, or an 18650 by using an extension tube. I followed the release of the Ti Tripple with a second design. I produced a limited edition run of the  Ti II , an 18650 powered triple. In 2016, ReyLight was officially created as its own company, at this time two new models were produced - the  Brass Pineapple , and the first version of the  Ti Lan , both were a huge hit across the world.               Version 1 of the Ti Lan    At the time, most AA flashlights were around 100 lumens. I designed my lights to be able to use either the common AA cell, or a 14500 Li-ion battery which gave the option to triple the output to 470 lumens! I also solved another common issue people had, which was most available lights use a cool white LED. I opted for a Nichia 219C, at a much warmer tint of 4000k. These emitters have a colour similar to that of sunlight, due to a much higher CRI (Colour Rendering Index) than most commercially used LED's. The Nichia emitters are a favourite amongst the hobby for this reason. Once again, we listened to the feedback given by users from all over the world, and went on to produce the second version of the Lan - another success story!       This brings us to where we are today...  We are here to produce our third version of the Ti Lan. It brings with it the biggest update so far, while still maintaining the key features which set it apart from the competition in the first place. More modes, active-temperature control, milled slots for up to 10 tritium vials, a new pocket clip and much more! Due to the high costs of ordering the Titanium rods required for a production run, along with deposits and other costs for the manufacturer, we decided to call for the help of you. In return, you will receive your very own Ti Lan!                       ÃÂÃÂ Why choose the Ti Lan?    With a body made of titanium weighing only 65g (2.3oz), you get the benefits and strength of Titanium while keeping the weight low.   You can customise your Lan to your liking by installing 1.5x6mm Tritium vials into the 10 slots around the light.   We used a 4000k Nichea LED, allowing 4 different levels, between 0.2 lumens and 470 lumens (by using a 14500 cell).ÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ  The Ti Lan has been proven to work well with:   Eneloop Rechargable's  Duracell Alkaline's  Energiser Lithium Primary'sÃÂÃÂ   Sanyo 14500 Li-Ion's  Reylight 800mAh 14500 Li-Ion's        ÃÂÃÂ  Detailed Specs:    Material: Solid Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V, Grade 5)  LED: 4000k Nichia 219C High CRI  Compatible cells: AA or 14500  Finish: Bead blast  Dimensions: 97x21mm (3.8x0.8in)  Weight (without battery): 65g (2.3oz)   Maximum output: 470 lumens  Minimum output: 0.2 lumens  Reverse polarity protection  Low Voltage Protection to prevent damage to Li-Ion cell's  Active temperature control, to prevent damage to the LED/Driver  Anti-Reflective (AR) coated lens  Aluminium Orange Peel reflector  Reverse-clicky switch   Ability to tablestand  Improved pocket clip  Spare O-Rings  10 tritium slots (installed tritium vials are an additional option)   The optional charging kit includes an 800mAh ReyLight 1400 Li-Ion cell, a Liitokala Lii-100 charger and a Micro USB charging cable.        ÃÂÃÂ Operation:    Fully click to turn on, followed by half-press (tap) to change modes. Fully click again to turn off.  Starts at moonlight (0.2 lumens) by default  Memory can be switched on or off by giving the button 8 quick taps.          ÃÂÃÂ Delivery:   Our goal is to ship the first batch of lights at the beginning of March 2018.ÃÂÃÂ We are ready to purchase the materials and begin production immediately after the project is successfully funded. (We are aware the rewards state delivery in Feb 2018 - this is a small error due to a delay in Kickstarters approval process).  Upon successfulÃÂÃÂ backing, you may receive a survey to confirm details such as tritium colours and such. We look forward to hearing from you!      Risks and challenges  As with any project, there are some risks.   ReyLight is an established small brand with a supply chain in place and we are experienced working with high quality manufactures, therefore there are minimal risks. Delayed shipping is a possibility as this is an international project. Unfortunately, if we donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t meet our goals the project wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t be possible due to Kickstarter's All-or-Nothing model - hopefully this is not the case, and we will be able to bring more ReyLight Ti LAN's to the world, at a more affordable price."

Many soaps contain chemicals that harm fish and degrade water quality. When you wash your car in the driveway, the soap together with the dirt, grime, grease, and oil washes from your car and flows into nearby storm drains. These can run directly into lakes, rivers, or streams.Some soaps may also contain phosphates, which can cause excess algae to grow in local waterways. Algae look bad, smell bad, and harm water quality. As algae decay, the process uses up oxygen in the water that fish need to survive.     With Hooptie you don't use soaps! And don't wash anything down the drain!        The average car wash uses 60-100 gallons of water depending on whetherÃÂÃÂ you use a hose, or go to a car wash.

Ever wondered what is hiding into your day-to-day devices? Papier Machine Vol.0 is  the first interactive electronic paper toy that unveils the mysteries of electronic black boxes.   Play with Papier Machine and apprehend the world of electronics!       Papier Machine is an expedition into the invisible aesthetics of circuits  where paper, electricity, graphics and play meet.   Circuits hide a surprising narrative potential whose stories Papier Machine chose to tell extending the possibilities of paper from colours and shapes with conductive ink.   Papier Machine Vol.0 is the first volume of a collection of thematic books. The theme of this volume is  the sound .   Awarded :        Featured in: ÃÂÃÂ         Papier Machine is a beautiful book...         ... of 6 electronic paper toys ready to be assembled.          ÃÂÃÂ  NÃÂÃÂ°1 - Resistance -  Like any music instrument, this piano needs to be tuned. The pitches are determined by hand-drawn graphite zones. Graphite being conductive, these zones complete the circuit. Closing the doors finishes to close the circuit producing for each of them a unique sound. Hence offering infinite possibilities to create a unique piano.       ÃÂÃÂ  NÃÂÃÂ°2 - Gyroscope -  Steel conducts electricity. The marble inserted in the slit connects the two parts of the circuit. By tilting the sheet, the marble rolls towards the battery and the sound intensifies.       ÃÂÃÂ  NÃÂÃÂ°3 - Playing track -  Gravity makes the metallic marble roll down. Every time the marble crosses a hand-drawn graphite zones, it closes the circuit and a sound is played. The track becomes a music sheet played as it is read by the rolling marble.        NÃÂÃÂ°4 - Wind sensor -  Wind, breath and air agitation get the silver fringes to touch, hence closing the circuit. Depending on the quantity of air blown and its location, the contact zone evolves and so does the sound.        NÃÂÃÂ°5 - Writing track -  Shaking the game sheet creates a centrifugal force that keeps the marble against the sides. Higher -or lower- pitched notes are played when the marble crosses thinner or wider hand-drawn graphite zones.         NÃÂÃÂ°6 - Tilt switch -  The marble is set at the bottom of an unstable base, on which shapes are gradually piled up. If balance is lost, the marble starts rolling and then crosses silver zones, setting off the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>loserÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ sound.    All brought to life with key components!        Each toy comes with its own user manual.            ÃÂÃÂ  Manipulate paper   Papier Machine is more than a regular book. You can cut it, fold it, assemble it, color it, build out of it a whole family of paper toys.   Build electronic circuits   Printed with silver ink, the potential of paper is infinite.

Any doubt? Anything?  Click here  to start Facebook chatting with us :)      Risks and challenges  Risks and challenges are inevitable when launching a new product. Especially when your product has never been produced before. We guarantee you that we have minimized both : the entire process, from production to delivery, has already been pre-arranged.   From the first prototypes we produced last year to be exhibited at the MusÃÂÃÂ©e des Arts DÃÂÃÂ©coratifs in Paris, we have learned a lot about the production process and its mistakes. And we know now how to do better.   As for this final version, we have made prototypes testing. We only need time to test a first series of what will soon be in your hands to make sure you hold the best possible quality.   We come from different worlds and have complementary skills. Our two designers, Marion and RaphaÃÂÃÂ«l, are used to managing projects from creation to production with partners. Raphael even co-founded a first start-up 5 years ago which is now living ""la belle vie"". Agnes comes from a more businessy world where she developed the skills needed to make Papier Machine live longer. The three of us have the technical expertise to do this and do it well. Luckily, we're surrounded   by many people motivated to support Papier Machine willing to help bringing their expertise. And if needed, we will not hesitate to call on them.  We will do our best to meet the deadlines. Still, in case of unplanned events, count on us to keep you up to date."

We at Scentee are all about the smell experience. Back in 2013 we launched a successful campaign at a  Japanese crowd funding site , and got our first smart gadget "" Scentee Balloon "" off. It hit the world by a storm, successfully selling over 20,000 units.   For our next step, we wanted to try a ""product"" that can be used in every house. We looked at the objects around us, and found something that was hidden in plain site. The diffuserÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ. We created over 100 prototypes, and each time, our focus was on how to make the simplest, yet sexy design, that people will like whatever point in time they were in.     Some sketches of older prototypes    Our goal was clear, we wanted the simplest functional design. It had to be sexy and timeless. Some of the designs were very amazing on paper, but when we made prototypes of them, they weren't functional. Together with our manufacturing partner, we produced prototype over prototype, every time taking inspiration from a different life scene, until we reached what we thought was the ultimate design.  This design, the Scentee Machina, is a base that can be put on any flat surface, and detachable perfume parts. The base is connected with the internet, meaning you can program it the way you like.

Press KIT             Risks and challenges  We have been working with our manufacturing partner for over 5 years, and have delivered B2C products (Scentee Balloon), and B2B products to world renown brands at as much as 10,000 unit/month. So in this sense, we have extreme confidence in delivering on a mass scale.   Our concern is keeping the quality level where we want, and making sure the app integration works well with most of the phones out there. We will be flying in to the manufacturer's factory every week to check on progress. We also have partnered with a big software testing firm in Japan to make sure the app will be up to standard."

Their vision was to develop not only an ergonomically correct desktop accessory, but to make a truly portable stand up desk.After playing as a football lineman on a state championship high school team, Drew suffered from back pain. Sitting all day aggravated his discomfort. His dad, Dave, suggested a standing desk. However, standing desks were pricey and most couldn't be moved to various locations as needed for Drew's job.  And the desktop model on the market either weren't portable or weren't ergonomically correct.So, priding himself as a &quot;redneck engineer&quot; capable of using unorthodox methods for elegant solutions, Dave began planning and experimenting. Initial efforts started in their garage, with crude cardboard cutouts, advancing to simple plywood models. As the design advanced, CAD drawings were developed, various material tested, and prototypes developed. As the Raised Desk evolved, so too did Dave and Drew's understanding of anthropometrics (basically the study of the human body and movement - we learned this word too while working on this project) and ergonomic design.Dave is a field advisor in the construction industry and sidelines as an MMA judge. Drew is a sales strategy manager for a national services organization after working for a Big Four consulting firm and is a whiskey connoisseur.

Some stand-up desks on the market are little more than a table to place on your desktop, possibly aligning your arms in the correct position, but forcing you to bend your neck significantly downward to an ergonomically incorrect position. Other products allow for the shelves to be moved, but often not independently. With these other products, your neck might be correct, but your arms are not.  The Raised Desk allows users to make sure both their arms and neck are in the correct positions.ÃÂÃÂ       To be ergonomically correct when standing, users' arms should be parallel to the floor, and their neck in an upright, neutral position.    Anthropometric studies show for users to be comfortable and in an ergonomically correct position, their forearms should be at a 90-degree angle to their elbow.  Users' necks should be vertical, to a slight tilt forward of up to 15 degrees downward, sometimes referred to as the resting sight line. Keyboard heights that vary from this can cause wrist and hand issues.  Tilting one's neck to view a screen that is too low can cause neck issues and vision fatigue.  The Raised Desk is designed to meet these constraints using a standard 30"" high desk for users from 5'0"" to 6'4"" tall, about 99% of the population.ÃÂÃÂ   Set-Up is a Breeze - No Tools RequiredÃÂÃÂ          You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Despite expert advice to stand at least two hours per day, the average office worker sits ten hours per day. Sitting at a computer for extended periods of time at work, school, and home is both uncomfortable and unhealthy.  However, leading a typical American lifestyle doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t have to be an automatic sentence to higher risks of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, muscle and joint pain, or early death. Exercise can counteract the effects of sitting all day, but it is not easy to get in time at the gym each day after ten hours of time is spent working and commuting. A more efficient way to reduce the impacts of sitting all day long is to work while standing.ÃÂÃÂ   The Health Benefits of the Raised DeskÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ A 2012 study found that if the average American reduced his or her sitting time to three hours per day, life expectancy would climb by two years. Each 2-hour increase in sitting time per day, their risk of colon cancer increased by 8 percent, and women's risk of endometrial cancer increased by 10 percent.ÃÂÃÂ   A good roundup of standing desk benefits follows:ÃÂÃÂ   Calories Burned Standing vs. Sitting    https://www.livestrong.com/article/73916-calories-burned-standing-vs.-sitting   ""The simple act of standing instead of sitting may help you burn 20 to 50 more calories per hour, depending on your size. Although that may not seem like a lot in a 2,000-calorie day, making the standing adjustment for four hours each day can burn an extra 80 to 200 calories -- helping you lose 8 to 20 pounds over the course of a year. Standing more often also contributes to an overall better sense of well-being and health.""ÃÂÃÂ    Five Health Benefits of Standing DesksÃÂÃÂ     Spending more of your day standing could reduce the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.     https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/five-health-benefits-standing-desks-180950259/   ""The solution, they say, isn't to sit for six hours at work and then head to the gym afterward, because evidence suggests that the negative effects of extended sitting can't be countered by brief bouts of strenuous exercise.

Feature list...   Built In USA  24 total modes of operation  Running Lights (can be enabled or disabled)  Boot Pattern (can be enabled or disabled)  Ability to Self Regulate Blink Rate  Animated Turn Signal Patterns  SynchronousÃÂÃÂ Animated Turn Signal Patterns  Standard Turn Signal Patterns  Programmable with a simple magnet (or without a magnet)  Water and weather proof.

Works on 12v DC Electrical Systems Only (Does NOT work on AC)  Flexible flasher stays to reduce risk of damage upon impact  For Front or Rear of motorcycle  Replaceable Lenses (Orange, Gray, Clear available)  Comes in pairs (one LEFT and one RIGHT turn signal per package)   Not to be confused with our Animated Turn Signal (ATS) Product. This product is a more advanced successor to the ATS product model. This product offers 16 more operation modes, boot pattern disable capability, as well as newÃÂÃÂ SynchronousÃÂÃÂ AnimatedÃÂÃÂ Chase patterns and Synchronous Sequential Blink patterns.  Funds raised will go toward the immediate production of the new Advanced Animated Turn Signals, our production run timeline is estimated to be 6 to 8 weeks after the campaign has ended.   Safety   The more eye catching visibility the better, as many motorcycles know, for safety reasons it is important to catch the eyes of that car or truck driver around you. These turn signals offer the extra eye catching visibility that other aftermarket turn signals lack.   Patterns and Programming   Programming can be done with a simple magnet from your refrigerator, or using the signal wire before install. We have several eye catching patterns slated for this product (and we might add more before the production run). Current patterns are...   Animated Chase (blink rate self regulated)  Synchronous Animated Chase (blink rate regulated by flasher relay)  Synchronous Sequential (blink rate regulated by flasher relay)  Fixed Normal FlashÃÂÃÂ (blink rate self regulated)  Normal Flash (blink rate regulated by flasher relay)  Inverted FlashÃÂÃÂ (blink rate regulated by flasher relay)   All patterns have the ability to operate with or without running lights enabled. All patterns have the ability to operate with or without the boot pattern enabled.   Simple To Setup   Holding the magnet to the tip of the turn signal before turning on the ignition key will enter the turn signal into programming mode, release the magnet when desired signal mode is selected.   Water and Weatherproof   In addition to the housings being weather and waterproof, the circuit boards of this product have an additional waterproof coating process which completely seals the circuit board, preventing water or weather from damaging it. Serious off-road riders will appreciate this feature, since bikes often get dropped in creeks or ponds during rough off-road riding.   USA Quality   12oClockLabs electronic parts and designed, tested, and built right here in the USA. We are veryÃÂÃÂ meticulous about product quality, functionality, and reliability. We also stand behind our products with USA based email and phone support.           Risks and challenges  The 12oClockLabs team is very proficient at motorcycle product manufacturing, we have been around since 2008 and our electronic parts are designed, tested, and built here in the USA. We are confident in our production timeline schedule and if any production delays arise will be sure to notify our backers quickly."

The school is called  Project Favela ; itÃÂÃÂ is managed and operated by a team of international volunteers and has been in operation since 2009.  Project Favela has almost 60 children per day pass through their doors, and they offer drama, music, civics and a STEAM Academy (science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics) program free of charge. They also offer a girl empowerment program and adult English classes in the evenings.  Until now, Project Favela has never had to solicit help directly. On September 19th a fragile peace was broken by a cartel war. The school is riddled with bullet holes and the violence has turned the volunteer recruiting upside down and dried up their revenue streams.   In spite of the violence, Project Favela has not closed its doors. It is quite literally one of the only places the children have to feel safe.

The good news is that the  Konnected Wifi Module is developed, tested and is currently shipping.  We need the money to help fund our marketing and equipment financing strategies.  Our friends in the cell phone world have us all trained to want equipment with no upfront cost.  I love it as a consumer but, as a business owner, it is very expensive.ÃÂÃÂ      Module Configuration Station       Shipping Station    ÃÂÃÂ Why not choose a perk and give it a try. I guarantee that you will be glad that you did.  Need more detail on what the module is capable of?ÃÂÃÂ  Here is the techno speak:   Device Summary:ÃÂÃÂ    The Konnected-SIM4 is a high performance mission critical enterprise grade rugged router with a cellular embedded LTE Advanced (LTE 2) modem that supports LTE bands B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B7, B8, B12, B13, B17, B20, B25, B26, B29, B30 &amp; B41.  It is made for customers that want the best signal reception and speed. Since this router has band 12, customers using the new 700Mhz frequency will get the best performance.  This module also supports Carrier Aggregation.  Carrier Aggregation is like having 2 modems in 1 device as it bonds and connects multiple times to the provider to get the fastest and most stable connection possible with the lowest latency.ÃÂÃÂ   Made to work for M2M applications, the Konnected router packs a powerful punch with its 2 x 5dBi wifi external antennas that are able to push the wifi signal as far as possible while maintaining the fastest speeds. Also includes 2 x 5dBi 3G/4G/LTE external antennas for the cellular signal that are able to get the strongest signal reception possible.ÃÂÃÂ   The Konnected SIM-4 is a completely remotely managed network device. 99% of the time we package the device with T-mobile but do have options for AT&amp;T and  Verizon.ÃÂÃÂ   Want to actually earn money with your internet service?  We have software that creates a captive portal with the ability to monetize the service that you provide to others.  We handle all of the technical details, money collection and revenue share with you.  You are able to control access times, bandwidth and data limits for each user. ÃÂÃÂ    Advanced Wireless SecurityÃÂÃÂ    The Konnected-SIM4 creates a secure Wi-FiÃÂÃÂ® network by supporting the latest wireless security features to prevent unauthorized access.  It supports many security options including 64/128-bit WEP, WPA, and WPA2 + more commercial grade security options to ensure that you will be able to secure your Wi-Fi network, regardless of your client devices.  In addition, the 3G/4G/LTE mobile router utilizes dual active firewalls (SPI and NAT) to prevent potential attacks from across the Internet.ÃÂÃÂ    Easy to install and UseÃÂÃÂ    Simply receive the device and plug it into power (12VDC and 110VAC versions available).  The system comes ready with a data account and preset to the SSID and Password of your choosing.  For those that use the router in a critical situation, enable the  Watchdog system that will reboot the router automatically if there is a loss of an internet connection.ÃÂÃÂ    Feature Details :ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	Built in 3G/4G/LTE Cellular Embedded Modem with multiple LTE bands that supports LTE, xLTE and LTE2 (LTE Advanced)ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	Carrier Aggregation support to get the fastest speeds possible (up to 300Mbps download and 50 Mb/s upload using latest cat 6 module)  ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	Band 12 support for T-Mobile customers looking to get the best coverage possible using the new 700MHz bandÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	Wireless Bridge/Repeater mode to extend your wireless range and/or have the ability to use an Ethernet connection with any wifi signal including those from a hotspot deviceÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	Konnected to Konnected VPN mode to allow a secure encrypted connection between officesÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	Super Fast (wireless speeds up to 300Mb/s full N speeds) up to 1000 ft rangeÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	Virtual Private Network (VPN) + OPENSWAN IPSec and OpenVPN SupportÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	Multi-Wan with fail safe (if one connection fails, can set to auto connect to another)ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	WiFi Fail Over (great for boater or anyone that gets free wifi and only use 4G/LTE when not in range)ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	Detachable 7 inch 5dBi antennas allowing flexible gain performance antennas both wifi and 4G/LTEÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	Dynamic DNS full support including customized optionÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¢	Available Ethernet out cable to attach to wired network      Risks and challenges  Most of the risk is gone away as the product development component of the project is complete.   We have successfully designed, developed, tested this product and have real customers in the marketplace.  Our biggest challenge is getting the word out and keeping up with the equipment financing options that we offer.  The more successful the indiegogo campaign, the faster we can ramp up production.  This is not our first rodeo.  We have been entrepreneurs for the last 25+ yrs and have brought many successful products and companies to the marketplace including Malibu Boats and Action Security.  The Konnected Wifi module is one of several products in the Konnected Ecosystem that we have designed and brought to market.  Please visit Konnectedtechnology.com for more information."

Sunlight, candlelight and firelight contain all the colors of the rainbow.ÃÂÃÂ  Skin tones, colors and details look their best when illuminated with natural full spectrum light.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ If a light source has too much of one color, and/or lacks certain colors, then people, places and things don't look right.ÃÂÃÂ  Fluorescent light makes everything look unnaturally green, and LED's give everything a bluish hue.ÃÂÃÂ  Check out ourÃÂÃÂ  blog post ÃÂÃÂ on artists exploring how light impacts aesthetics, or ask any designer about color theory. mySun uses a new light engine technology which actively mixes together all the colors of the rainbow to deliver the perfect balance of natural full spectrum light.ÃÂÃÂ  Look and see your best with mySun!        We are programmed to respond to the daily and seasonal variations of natural light . Until 100 years ago our days were filled with bright sunlight, and our evenings were lit with the soft warm glow of a flame.  We feel bright and energized on a sunny day, and down on rainy days, during dark winter months or when weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve been stuck inside for too long.  Exposure to light is what drives our hormone cycles and synchronizes our circadian rhythms ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> profoundly impacting how we feel, work, play and rest. For more on how light impacts our health and wellness check out our  science page .ÃÂÃÂ  Unfortunately, most of us donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t get enough natural light during the day and get too much artificial light at night.  The science linking light and health is clear, and the technology to recreate natural light is now available. Feel better, be more productive, and rest easier with mySun!       ÃÂÃÂ   Testimonials from bottled sunshine users:  natural light enhances vision and aesthetics       natural light improves sleep       ÃÂÃÂ natural light boosts mood and energy       natural light is ideal for new parents       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ         Natural light changes with the time of day , ranging from bright and cool during the day to soft and warm in the evenings.  These daily cycles of sunlight (rich with bio-active blue) and candle or fire light at night (reddish light with no bio-active blue) are a cornerstone of our health and wellness.  For the first time, a new class of LED light engines makes it possible to deliver the daily and seasonal cycles of natural light by actively mixing together the different colors of the rainbow!ÃÂÃÂ  These next-generation light sources are now being adopted in high-end design projects around the world ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> unfortunately you canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t get this technology without talking to an architect or lighting designer and hiring contractors.

Fluorescent lights don't contain all the colors of the rainbow, it's no accident that we look green and feel off under fluorescent lighting.  Most LED light sources emit too much blue light, delivering a cold and unnatural light.  Today's artificial light sources do not provide enough light during the day to make us feel 'awake and alert' and provide too much light at night for us to naturally relax and sleep.  Check out this  blog post  for more on the difference between natural and artificial light.  The good news is that we no longer need to settle for artificial light, we can have energy efficiency without sacrificing the beauty or health benefits of natural light!        We've been shipping natural lighting solutions around the world since December 2016. ÃÂÃÂ  Do you know someone who works in a windowless cubicle, or spends their day under fluorescent lights?ÃÂÃÂ  Is there someone in your life who struggles with sleep, or has the winter blues?ÃÂÃÂ  Is your family blessed with a new baby or a moody teenager?ÃÂÃÂ  Is it difficult for you to get outside regularly, or do you live in a climate with limited sun?ÃÂÃÂ  To read more about how light can help support your mood, productivity and sleep check out our  blog . Our mySun and bottled sunshine lamps automatically produce sunlight during the day (to boost your mood/energy) and then switch to candle light at night to make it easier to unwind and sleep.

Meet Sunlight Inside's passionate and experienced TEAM!        ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  We're a small company doing our best to build a business the old-fashioned (honest) way.  We are dedicated to delivering quality products made of natural materials (glass, wood and metal) which are energy efficient and built to last 10-20 years.  We hand build all of our products, and source sustainable materials and labor - all right here in California.  We're a small and experienced team, and we have done this before!   Last year we launched bottled sunshine, a simple and elegant table lamp which automatically delivers the daily and seasonal cycles natural light right out of the box.  We now have hundreds of users enjoying beautiful, healthy natural light around the world.  We learned a lot building and shipping our first products last year, extra special thanks to our early adopters who were very patient and provided great feedback.  Check out the user testimonials on our website and the reviews on our Facebook page.  We've incorporated our 'lessons learned', optimized our supply chain and tweaked the design of our custom controller.  Our experience building and shipping bottled sunshine has prepared us for the launch of mySun.  Please help us bring beautiful, healthy natural light indoors!  For the launch of mySun we're limiting our pre-holiday deliveries to 50 mySun desk lamps and 50 bottled sunshine table lamps to ensure our shipments go out on time.  Parts are arriving now and we have high confidence we'll be able to deliver these initial pre-holiday units.  We're offering discounts for those of you who don't mind waiting for a January delivery.  Our custom electronics have been in customers hands for over a year now with excellent reliability, our biggest 'issue' has been breakage of the glass shades.  We took some pain last year, ironing out last minute production issues which delayed our shipments, but we've learned our lessons and are proactively managing this risks, while also limiting the size of the first production batch.  We are offering lower prices for those that don't have-to-have a lamp before the holidays, and the second batch of shipments is scheduled for January - so you won't have to wait long.  We approach this differently than other kickstarter campaigns in that we will start shipping product BEFORE our campaign ends.  Please help us deliver light the way nature intended!"

As a small but dedicated team located in the US, Netherlands and China we look for designers who have an aspiration for something but lack the knowhow to make their dream come true.  We came a cross the PowerStrip Modular idea when meeting with a Chinese designer called Dominic. He was keen on doing something about the piles of thrown away adaptors, chargers and other e-tech waste that was lying around in some cities in China.   He came up with the idea of creating a PowerStrip that would include modules that provide universal solutions for day to day necessities.        By making them modular, he could at least contribute partially to the reduction of the piles of e-waste since with this solution, people wouldn't have to throw away the parts they didn't need anymore since they could easily resell them or give them away to people who could still have use for them. After creating his first designs, he needed help getting his product to market...       So we have the idea, the goal, the design, the technical know-how and a team of people that will help bring Dominic's idea to life. Now all that rests is you! The people who will make this dream a reality by supporting us. Not only will you make your life more convenient and future-proof by introducing modular tech into your home, but you will also be a part of a movement that will reduce e-waste throughout the world!       By supporting PowerStrip Modular you will contribute to a community of people that is keen on reducing e-waste. On top of that, by spreading the PowerStrip Modular into the world, we ensure an end to outdated tech as you can always give, sell or send back modules you don't need anymore and we will make sure they find a second home!            That which we have in our hands, we can control. Though with every project, there are always things that are out of your control. Here's what we think could face some bumps in the road:    Timing . Even with the best of estimates, there are always unforseen circumstances that can occur that delay certain processes in manufacturing, distribution, quality control, ... which cause delays.   What we can do about it ? Provide a buffer that allows for some delays without you noticing it. All that can come from it is that in the best case scenario, we can deliver things earlier than reported!     Communication . Even though we are hard at work communicating with everyone and answering everyones concern, when a project gets really big, we found that there's a hard time answering every message or mail since a lot of the requests are very time consuming and we have limited resources to deal with those painpoints.   What can we do about it?  We are thinking of a solution to provide better support to everyone by better working with the FAQ section and with automated email responses but we still need to figure out the best and most natural way to make sure everyone gets helped in a timely fashion. We know that with the Heng Balance Lamp this is a real challenge for us since we have more than 5000 people reaching out to us but we are working on improving this!      Technical challenges . Creating tech is hard, creating modular tech is even harder. There are many bits and pieces, new functions and modular solutions that have to harmoniously work together in order to ensure a successful PowerStrip Modular.    What can we do about it?  Work with the best in the field of PowerStrips. For us that meant working with Allocacoc, their designer experience and know-how of how each and every individual function works for the modules we need, will help us achieve our technologic goals.         Sometimes you happen to be in a situation where you really like the project, would love the product, but there's still something that prevents you from supporting financially. If that's the case, you can still do a whole lot of things to support us! Here are a few examples:    Share our project  on any social media, and when we say any, we mean any! Because PowerStrip is for everyone, everywhere in the world. Language barriers restrict us from posting on social medias in Russia, the middle east or South America, but if you know the language and want to support, please do so!      Follow us on  facebook   and share our posts.                             Risks and challenges  We noticed that the main challenge of the PowerStrip is making it modular and making it available worldwide.   To overcome this challenge, we partnered up with Allocacoc, a brand known for it's amazing PowerCube and other power supplying products. They believe in our ideas and have given us the necessary resources in know-how to ensure that our ideas are feasible."

It uses servo motors to press buttons on the console and has a webcam mounted to detect changes on the console's top screen and a light sensor mounted on the bottom. A number of programs have already been written for the Pokemon series games including automatic breeding and soft resetting for shiny Pokemon. Note, existing programs are for windows only, not mac. For more information on the device itself please visit the official Facebook page or Youtube Channel.  www.facebook.com/noobysgamepro  www.youtube.com/channel/UCzXJBiQ81WSeNGn89OUyY1Q  The GamePRo product has been on the market as a fabricated plastic or aluminium unit produced by CNC machining or 3D printing. These were expensive to manufacture and were making the cost of the unit too pricey for most customers. By Injection molding these parts the cost will reduce substantially, however this requires a significant investment for the tooling of the mold. This Kickstarter is all about raising the funds to cover the tooling costs which will make the GamePRo accessible to many more people.      Risks and challenges  The GamePRo has been out for several years now so the software is working smoothly and users aren't finding it difficult to use.  So we feel there is little risk in this area of the project.  Our aim for this campaign is to significantly reduce costs by changing the tooling used to manufacture the GamePRo.  So the biggest risk would be if there were an issue with the new tooling, such as the design being slightly out.  We do not feel that a problem here will stop the work from happening as significant work has gone into the design stage including 3D printed prototype versions.  At worst it may cause delays in getting rewards out to people.  Regardless we will still have our old method of producing GamePRos as an option if this method fails.  So we will do our best to ensure funders get their rewards.  Another risk for purchasers of the GamePro would be if significant changes were made to the console that made the GamePro model obsolete.  This however, would not be in the near future, and obviously wouldn't affect people with the games there currently have.  So not a major problem really.  But it is worth noting that if the consoles change in the future then the GamePRo will have to be upgraded to suit. Currently the original 3DS versions (Standard and XL) and the new 3DS versions (Standard and XL) are supported."

ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ Strategy is about making choices, trade-offs, it's about deliberately doing something different. We believe we are driving a Generation shift, the Ghost S1 changes a lot, it is like nothing we have ever seen before. It will likely have a significant impact on the market ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> a new normal ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> and we hope to see other manufacturers start replicating it. The PC community deserves more refined products that are designed do last! With the Ghost S1 base XS platform we have focused on the essentials and thrown everything that is not critical out the window to prioritize what really matters ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> some of which are: Cooling performance, ease of build, noise reduction and build quality.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ            ÃÂÃÂ        The minimalistic design of GHOST S1 is not just looks ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> despite its modest dimensions, it carries countless unique features never seen in a computer case before.   Read about its  size ,  performance ,  flexibility ,  quality ,  compatibility  and  innovative architecture  below.  IMMACULATE ATTENTION TO DETAILS   Milled from solid blocks of aluminum, this case offers a level of quality not seen other PC computer case out there. Glass blasted anodized aluminum exterior, Red heli-coils, pressed stainless steel stand-offs and polished neodymium magnets are just a couple of details that make this case stand out above all others. Nothing has been left untouched, every millimeter of this case has been carefully considered and purposely designed to maintain this level of quality in every single detail.       NO MORE DELIDDING OR DOWNVOLTING  Forget throttling, overheating, noise and performance loss. With the Ghost S1 you will never have to worry about those things anymore. The Ghost is likely to perform significantly better than your full-size system you are rockn' today. Compare it with any other sub 20-liter case and you will be blown away. At the bottom of this page you will find links to our test documents, please read through the CPU AIR cooler report carefully, if you have the possibility to run the same test on your own system, please do to get an idea of what this little ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>badboyÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ is capable of!      Link to CPU AIR cooler test document      THE CONCEPT  The GHOST S1 is easiest described in detail by looking at four different structural stages: (1) The Spine, (2) the Core, (3) the side panels and (4) the TopHats.    1. THE SPINEÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ This is where most of the engineering hours have been spent. Maximizing functionality while simplifying the layout has been the primary guiding principle throughout the design process. The hardware of your choice is mounted directly to the Spine making it the single most vital component of the case. The voids have been carefully calculated to allow multiple points of entry during build without compromising the structural integrity of the case - so convenient that we have a patent pending.   2. THE CORE        ÃÂÃÂ Without using any tools, the case is quickly ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>undressedÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ, leaving you with the Core where alterations to your config easily can be made. Simply pull the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>GrillÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ up, slide the side panels out and you are in.  ÃÂÃÂ  3. THE SIDE PANELS        ÃÂÃÂ   Just like the gables, the side panels are made from extruded magnesium reinforced aluminum that is later CNC milled with 1.320 3 mm holes, the milling creates a gorgeous chamfer on every single hole, making the side panels ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>come aliveÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ.   4. TOPHATSÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ   We don't believe a computer case should be bigger than necessary. However, being a performance junkie sometimes means you need to fit more stuff than the Average Joe. The TopHat modules are designed to expand the volume of your GHOST S1 XS, making it a S, M, or L. The TopHats are interchangeable between the top and the bottom position.      Build (air cooled)      Build (liquid cooled)   What about custom loops, will you be able to fit a custom made liquid cooling closed loop?   We have put a Ghost S1 in the hands of professional case modders to figure this one out. The system is equipped with some of the latest hardware such as an intel i7 8700K and EVGA 1080ti GPU. Follow the development of this exciting ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>balls-to-the-walls-buildÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ here:         Link to custom loop build logg (in Swedish)   Credits to Daniel FagerstrÃÂÃÂ¶m who is leading this custom loop project!  FORMATS &amp; COLORS       GHOST S1 comes in three colors and endless form factors - What's your combo? GHOST S1 could be configured in different sizes by adding TopHat(s) of your choice. What you choose to use the extra space for is up to you, but we made it ready to fit the most common 120 mm accessories like fans and radiators right out-of-the-box. The architecture and configurability remove the traditional limits of SFF cases and letÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s your imagination set the boundaries.        COLORS        ÃÂÃÂ   The Ghost comes in 3 colors, Ash, Limestone and Arctic. They two first are glass blasted to create a deep matt finish before anodized, the Arctic uses far more complex methods to achieve that gorgeous white finish:    Ash.  A dark (almost completely black) color that will disappear like a Ghost   Limestone.  This finish has no dye, instead the aluminum's natural color is used as a base and the glass blasting gives it a light mat finish   Arctic . A very special anodize method allows us to offer this unique white version, glossier than the other two and more expensive to produce, that's why we need to charge you another  250 SEK  for this option and no additional cost for TopHats in with this finish   Colors are selected after the campaign andÃÂÃÂ            YOUR COMBO    There are at least 75 permutations of this case, selecting the right one for you is understandably difficult. To give you more time to make up your minds, TopHats and colors will be selected through a survey after the campaign is over. Only one TopHat is possible to acquire through this platform. However, all backers that opt for a pledge including a TopHat will get the chance to acquire more TopHats before the delivery of the Ghost S1 through other channels.  SPECIFICATION GHOST MKII       ADD-ONS and STRETCH GOALS  Nonstop progression, the Ghost will not stop evolving. We have a list of add-ons that we need your help prioritizing! Naturally it is a win-win-situation to get these out, but at the same time we have limited resources at this point and our number one priority is to deliver the Ghost S1 platform on time ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> addons projects come second (TopHats aside). An over funded campaign will give us more financial maneuverability and allow us to jumpstart one or two add-on projects depending on their ease of implementation. As stretch goals we will get on a number of these projects right away and do everything in our power to have them ready before your Ghost is delivered.    150% funding level will result in 1 project being executed right away  200% funding level will result in 2 projects being executed right awayÃÂÃÂ   250% funding level will result in 3 projects being executed right away     Before the campaign is over we will present these add-ons to you in more detail and ask for your help to prioritize among them.

It is a much more refined product today and at the same time the fundamental idea and values have remained. The result should speak for itself, now more than ever! The updated Ghost has received several important improvements, some of the most important ones are listed below:ÃÂÃÂ      The entire shell is CNC milled instead of stampedÃÂÃÂ   Outer shell is glass blasted before anodized for a deep matt finish  The CPU cooler clearance has been increased from 63 mm to 66 mm for better compatibility  USB-ports have been removed from the XS model for an ultra-clean look  Slide-in side panels  TopHats are interchangeable between top and bottom position      SHIPPING  We aim for global distribution, however unfortunately some locations will be harder for our delivery penguins to reach. If your country is not highlighted on the map below and you still want to back us, do so and contact us after the campaign to figure out the best way of receiving your delivery.       THE PLAN &amp; TIMELINE  This campaign is a major milestone in our journey. Even if we have designed tons of stuff in our professional careers and are all born PC builders and gamers it wasn't until September 2016 we took on the challenge of building and designing the PC case of our dreams. After 180 days in the lab, one cancelled KS campaign, another 180 days in the lab we can finally present GHOST S1 MKII.         LIVESTREAMING DURING THE CAMPAIGN  We would love to show the Ghost hands on in a livestream later during the campaign, this will also give you the opportunity to ask all the questions you might have regarding the product, the process and the time-line ahead     WHO WE ARE AND WHERE WE ARE COMING FROM  The expectations on PC hardware performance has reached an all-time high. It feels like last Monday some of us wowed to the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>magicÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ of the Duck Hunt gun ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> today we take the 233 million pixels per second in our VR-glasses for granted. Meanwhile, PC hardware design and esthetics seem to be stuck in the early 2000ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s with what looks like Fast &amp; the Furious cars as design inspiration.    ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Being born PC builders and gamers now in our thirties, we had outgrown techy spaceships and dust collecting monsters. We wanted a Small Form Factor PC Case that did not only fit all the latest technology but also looked good enough to deserve a place in front of the sofa next to the TV Speakers. As we couldn't find anything matching our demands we decided to design our own...""         We are a team of entrepreneurial designers and engineers. We founded LOUQE with the ambition of changing the expectations of the PC entertainment and gaming hardware industry - forever.   Even if we sometimes believe we are good enough on our own to meet that promise, we are not! The success of our projects all rest in the hands of our beloved partners, network and the community. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve learned the lesson that you need great people to create great stuff. That's why we spent a lot of time, effort, and persuasion in finding and partnering up with some of the best engineers, designers, suppliers, innovators, gurus, fans and end-users the market has to offer - together we can create better products, more efficiently in shorter time than the old fashion way  BUT WAIT... THERE IS MORE  We love the GHOST S1 and have so much to say. more than fits and makes sense to put on this page. Visit us on our homepage or on social media.ÃÂÃÂ Tell your friends about us  - together we can make this happen!   www.louqe.com   ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ        Risks and challenges  Unlike many other Kickstarter projects, we've been working on Ghost S1 for some time now and are ready to push the production button. We are in close contact with manufacturers who have made us our prototypes in near-live production environments. However, with crowd funded projects there are always risks involved. We consider the biggest risks to be exact shipment dates and the specifications (slight adjustments to colors, millimeters here and there etc.) however - we promise to report any differences from what has been specified on this site so that we can have an open and transparent dialogue - if needed.  We will post updates on the process and keep an open line of communication with the community and our backers.

It teaches how to produce, integrate and interact with different fluorescent proteins. Bixels makes biological tools and materials accessible and affordable to a wider audience.       The Bixel Bio-Display     BackgroundÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ    We are increasingly seeing the hybridization of biology with technology. Such hybrid products and services have begun to enter our everyday lives. Examples include, the bio-fabrication of human tissue for surgical repair and personalized medicine emerging from the rise of computational biology. The intentional blend of the natural and digital worlds will permeate our society and disrupt our traditional notions of technology.  This hybridization has demanded a new kind of cross disciplinary design-thinking which includes common fields of science and engineering, while also being more inclusive of the arts. We now have the ability to manufacture biological components that can act as interfaces (inputs and outputs) with our environments. These advancements offer new experiences that will fundamentally change the way we interface with our world, our bodies and each other.  However skills, tools and knowledge in this area are often not accessible to the general public. We are here to change that, with education and public engagement as our goals. This is how the idea of Bixels was born.       Bixels allows you to design, create and interact with your personal 8x8 bio-pixel display, such as making pictures, gifs and a variation of simple games - while learning about the basics of how to program with DNA and to build a biological circuit in comparison to traditional code and electronic circuits. In addition it demonstrates the possibilities of interacting with biological materials through physics and material explorations.  We decided to use gamification to allow a wi(l)der range of applications and explorations of biological interfaces. Therefore, Bixels -a biological pixel- is built in form of an 8x8 cartridge that works as a digital display. Each fluorescent pixel is programmed using DNA.  For example, we use a DNA circuit to produce green fluorescent protein (GFP), the same material that give jellyfish their colour ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093>  this protein is already used in lab experimentsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦. but we thought that it can be used for more.  The underlying LED matrix allows you to excite different fluorescent proteins (make them glow) through different light wavelengths in combination with filters. We designed it in a way that you can turn on/off bio-pixel through a simple app.       ÃÂÃÂ       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ        It is built with  cell-free technology . Our cell-free technology pulls the molecular machinery (or transcriptional/translation TXTL machinery) outside of a cell meaning there is no regulation or restrictions to use outside a lab.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ This extracted billion year old processor is responsible for reading DNA and writing proteins. While games consoles use code to program, cell-free uses DNA.

Bixels is therefore integrated in a STEAM curriculum using gamification as base. Bixels is a primitive DNA programmed bio-display that enables you to play tetris and other retro classics while teaching physics, computation, biology and digital fabrication. The curriculum around Bixels uses the example of Pixels, which have their origin in photography and are enabled by combining chemistry, physics and art. Today Pixels are defined as the basic unit of programmable color. Bixels builds on this and teaches about    Biology  through teaching about fluorescent proteins, their origin and how to produce themÃÂÃÂ    Physics  through teaching how to visualize fluorescent proteins with light waves and optical filters   Computation  and electronics through teaching how to interact and control them through programming LED arrays and their color   Digital Fabrication and Design  through teaching how to integrate the proteins into and with different materials for future products and manufacturing methods   For us the open ended and  do-it-yourself nature of the project  was important. Some kits can be very restrictive and limiting but we wanted that everyone can add their skills to the project and evolve it further. Nevertheless Bixels doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t want to address just makers and hackers and positions itself between a product and an educational tool to enable people to get started without particular skills.  We will reveil and add son a  full curriculum  how to use Bixels in class or workshops.   Stay tuned!      Workshop at CRI, Paris    ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ      Different cover same inside... our GameGirl Bio-Display    ÃÂÃÂ        Bixels is inspired by common lab equipment and activities within biological laboratories and designed as product to allow a wider audience take place in those explorations.  Nevertheless, we love its roots and its community. Bixels can be as well used as a transilluminator and simple plate reader in a lab environment. Those are lab equipments which allow scientists to visualize if their experiments worked.     No expensive plates! Just easily replaced PCR tubes!

The purpose was to create  a curriculum which makes biology more accessible . Our first tests were just made of an old transilluminator -sponsored by the Plant Science Department in Cambridge- some lasercut, and 3D printed parts. This encouraged us to make Bixels into a truly accessible and affordable way to become a bio-hacker and start the learning journey!     First Prototype at the Royal College of Art    ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        Our vision is to take biology out of the test tube. We can create sensors and tools using DNA circuits that compliment or replace electronics. Cells contain the worldÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s oldest processors with DNA as its assembly code... Our product breaks these processors out of the cell and puts it in the grasp of makers, creatives, hackers, and designers.

The Electric Eel Wheel MiniÃÂÃÂ is an affordable electric spinning wheel that makes yarn out of fiber.  The guy talking in the video is me, Maurice.ÃÂÃÂ  Also in the video were my wife, Emily, and my daughter.ÃÂÃÂ  The whole spinning wheel project started about eight years ago as a request from my girlfriend (now wife) to make her a travel friendly spinning wheel.ÃÂÃÂ  Then her friends wanted one, and I eventually started selling them online.ÃÂÃÂ  There is a great community around the Electric Eel Wheel spinning wheels at  Ravelry ÃÂÃÂ (it is like the Facebook for knitters and spinners and requires a login).ÃÂÃÂ  The community has been giving me great ideas on what kinds of features they would like to see in electric spinning wheels, and being an engineer I do my best to implement those great ideas.ÃÂÃÂ  I'm currently on version 5 of the EEW, but this is my first version of this miniaturized EEW.  Here are some of the best EEW Mini features:   Small and lightweight design makes it very portable  The metal sliding hooks are easy to use  No foot treadle means you can use is in more places like in your recliner or at a table  The motor handles the spinning which lets you focus on feeding the fiber to the wheel making this much faster and easier to use than drop spindles  Cost optimized design enables a much lower price than other spinning wheels   The Mini is on Kickstarter to help fund our first batch of manufacturing.ÃÂÃÂ  The retail price will be higher so you're getting a deal and you are getting one sooner.  One important note to backers outside the USA: the power supply that ships with the Mini works with voltages around the world, but it has a  Type A plug .ÃÂÃÂ  If you don't have Type A plugs, you would need to provide a physical adapter to convert from Type A to whatever plug type you have.     EEW Mini Views    Stretch Goals  Stretch goals reward backers with extra features if this project is funded beyond our initial goal.  Let me know what you would like to see as a stretch goal!ÃÂÃÂ    $25K (GOAL REACHED!) - Every Mini comes with a plastic spin card to help improve twist consistency of your yarn.ÃÂÃÂ   $50KÃÂÃÂ (GOAL REACHED!) - Every Mini comes with an extra belt sized for plying yarn.ÃÂÃÂ   $75K (GOAL REACHED!) - Every Mini comes with an orifice hook.   The more of your friends you tell about the EEW Mini, the more likely we are to hit the stretch goals and I will add more.  So spread the word on your favorite social websites.  Plying  Plying yarn is when you take two separate strands of yarn you've already spun and twist them together.ÃÂÃÂ  To do this you must twist the strands of yarn together in the opposite direction you've spun them.ÃÂÃÂ  The Mini can support this in two different ways.ÃÂÃÂ  The first is to swap the position of the black and red wires on the circuit board.ÃÂÃÂ  To do this you need a small flat head screwdriver to swap the wires according to the photo below.       ÃÂÃÂ The second option is to add a twist to the drive belt, but you will need a different sized one than the one included.ÃÂÃÂ  If you twist the one included it will be too tight and the wheel won't spin.ÃÂÃÂ   Here is the belt you'd need  if you want to do the twisted method of plying.       While the Mini can do plying, it isn't the ideal wheel for this.ÃÂÃÂ  When plying it's often nice to go at very high speeds with lots of tension.ÃÂÃÂ  The smaller motor on the Mini means you can only go at a moderate speed with light tension.ÃÂÃÂ  Also, the small bobbin means you'll have to change bobbins frequently since plying fills up bobbins much faster than spinning.  Bobbin Size  The bobbins on the Mini hold about 1.1 ounce.       Manufacturing  I source parts from around the world, but assembly and testing is done near my home in rural Massachusetts, USA.ÃÂÃÂ  I've used knowledge from the other spinning wheels I've designed and optimized the Mini for cost.  The major custom parts I've designed for this spinning wheel are:   Circuit board  Wooden case laser cut pieces  Injection molded spindle and slider bars  Triangle wire clamps for the slide bars   All of these parts are either ready for manufacturing or very close to ready.  Comparison to other Spinning Wheels  It is important to realize the Mini is a new category of spinning wheel.ÃÂÃÂ  It is much faster and easier to use than a drop spindle, and available at an amazing price that no other spinning wheel on the market approaches. It's design makes it great for new spinners and or more experienced spinners when they have a special niche that needs filling (like traveling, teaching younger children, or just experimenting with an electric spinning wheel without breaking the bank).ÃÂÃÂ  However, the Mini is not meant to work as a production spinning wheel.ÃÂÃÂ  So if you are an experienced spinner don't expect this to replace your primary spinning wheel.ÃÂÃÂ   The EEW5 is a high-end electric wheel I've made and sold, so I'll be using that as the basis for comparison.ÃÂÃÂ  The EEW5 is similar toÃÂÃÂ other good quality spinning wheel thus making this a good source of comparison for people familiar with other spinning wheels even if they aren't electric.ÃÂÃÂ  The reason for these differences is the Mini is five times less expensive than the EEW5.ÃÂÃÂ  To meet that price I made many design changes.ÃÂÃÂ  I have listed some of the major ones below:   The Mini uses a much smaller motor.ÃÂÃÂ  This also allows a smaller power supply.ÃÂÃÂ  It also means the max speed is slower on the EEW Mini, and the torque is lower.  The Mini's smaller size reduces the cost of the wooden pieces used in the case.ÃÂÃÂ  This also results in a very lightweight spinning wheel.ÃÂÃÂ  You see the Mini is attached to a book with a rubber band in the video to give it some weight.ÃÂÃÂ  The lightweight design is important because it reduces shipping costs.  The Mini's new flyer design uses sliding wire hooks instead of the stainless hooks used on the EEW5.ÃÂÃÂ  While I like the hook system on the EEW5 better, the hooks on the Mini are still better than a lot of other much more expensive spinning wheels out there.  The circuit board on the Mini uses a much simpler design that can only go in a single direction instead of both directions.ÃÂÃÂ  Also since the motor is smaller, the circuit board can use less expensive parts.  The Mini's flyer is plastic instead of metal like the one on the EEW5.ÃÂÃÂ  Where the yarn rubs on the plastic flyer will eventually start to wear.ÃÂÃÂ  If you use the Mini a lot you'll need to add something like aluminum tape to where the groove might form in the flyer, but that would take a substantial amount of spinning.        Press Kit  Please spread the word!ÃÂÃÂ  If you want to post to your news site, blog, Facebook page, forums, email your friends, or tell people about the EEW Mini, then I put high resolution of many photos of the EEW Mini  on this page ÃÂÃÂ for your use. Feel free to use anything from this Kickstarter page as well to tell others about the EEW Mini.      Risks and challenges  I have done a lot of testing with the current version of the EEW Mini. This includes sending out EEW Mini kits to seven other spinners for them to test.  The testing results have been positive, so I'm happy with the current design.  I have even had the injection molds for the plastic parts made already because I wanted to verify those parts before starting this Kickstarter.  One significant risk is production scale if this Kickstarter gets many more backers than the goal. While selling a lot of extra EEW Minis would be a blessing in some ways, it could also be a problem because might cause me to adjust manufacturing plans which could lead to delays.  As long as the number of EEW5 Minis I need to ship to backers stays under 500 this won't be a problem.  After that I should be able to handle 1000-2000 with only minor delays and hiring a few extra local assemblers.  Beyond that delays will probably increase.  It is always possible for factors beyond my control to delay shipping, such as one of my suppliers going out of business, but these risks are minimized since I have been working with most of my major suppliers for years. If this happens, the parts for the EEW Mini are not so specialized that I couldn't find alternative sources, so this rare scenario should only delay release.  This is not my first product so I know about a lot of the pitfalls and have worked hard to avoid them. If you look at my previous two Kickstarter campaigns you'll see one shipped on time and the other actually shipped early.  That said, I will delay shipping if some issue with quality is found.  I would rather delay shipping than ship a defective product."

CATOLET - the world's newest and unique automatic litter box for cats and small dogs that does not require any filler nor cleaning. It is based on a conveyor system for waste disposal with automatic washing of the conveyor belt and flushing to the sewer. Whenever the pet is placed inside the automatic tray, the sensor detects its presence and monitors when it leaves the CATOLET device. After a period of time, which is set individually, flushing is carried out. Waste is not collected in any container, filler is not required, whereas, the waste is crushed and washed down the sewer. After flushing, the device is ready for the use again.       The conveyor system lets all the liquid through without leaving a single drop. Paws of your pet will always be dry.

To the water supply and sewage systemThe kit includes 2.0 m hoses for connection.            ÃÂÃÂ 2. You can also connect to the nearest faucet and toilet bowl The kit includes 2.0 m hoses for connection.       Everything is simple!             ÃÂÃÂ  connection CATOLET basics                  ÃÂÃÂ In the CATOLET automatic box, a sensor is installed which detects leakage and malfunction of the water supply system, whenever it is activated, the system shuts the water supply and informs the owner of the malfunction. Thus, CATOLET is an autonomous system for protection against water leaks.This option is available in all versions of the device.       The device can be controlled and configured via mobile application. In the setup mode, you can set the binding time (this is very convenient, since all animals have their own character). The application runs on different mobile operating systems. In the mobile application, you can track the intervals and the number of trips of your pet, violation of cycles, water flow and other parameters. The tray is equipped with a leakage sensor, and in case of a sudden situation, the system will send a message to your smartphone.                 The case is made of sanitary acrylics; the conveyor belt is made out of composite materials that are resistant to claws and aggressive environment. Whereas, the conveyor tape is made with through holes, so that the pet does not wet its paws.       Designers will give a choice of five single-colored body colors-from pink to blue, as well as prints in the form of cat's paws or cute cat faces.                 We all know how cats like all sorts of dark and secluded places. For cat's comfort, we have developed a removable shelter in which your pet will feel wonderful! Thanks to special grooves, the shelter is easily attached to the automatic tray. In addition, the shelter has its own design and can serve as a shelf for various accessories, which is very convenient and saves space.            ÃÂÃÂ Our beloved pets have another problem ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> closed doors.

Any project could encounter unexpected obstacles, and this possibility is even more likely in the case of a technology project that requires device manufacturing. We have finalized designs of our product and a working prototype and already signed agreements with key components manufacturers and suppliers.  We have thoroughly studied successful crowdfunding campaigns ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> including those that delivered on-time and those that delayed delivery ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> in order to learn and improve upon our own process. All products shown in connection with this campaign are prototypes that demonstrate the intended function of the final device. The final product will require certain product certifications, which introduces third party variables to the production schedule. To mitigate this risk, we will design the products to be compliant with all requirements and pursue these certifications.  It is safe to say that we have reduced many of the risks typical of a hardware startup!  However, as with any newly manufactured product, it is possible that some unexpected events could impact the actual production time frame.

Hubserialixed has 3 USB Hub Ports - which are same as the ones in Hubpixed. We knocked off the 4th USB Port and added a USB to UART chip, that provides the ability to connect any UART device on that port.   This UART device could be anything you can think of - including a thermal sensor, ADC, Relay control, RF Module etc. Since this UART port works off the USB, you are not concerned about the inbuilt UART ports available on the 40 Pin Connector. In fact, none of the Pins of the 40 Pin connector are required to be used.   We have kept the 40 Pin Connector area vacant - so that these pins are still available to be used if you wish to.   The UART Pins are provided as 4 Pin JumperÃÂÃÂ  with following Pins  1. 3.3V  2. UART TX  3. GND  4. UART RX  There are two mounting holes in the design and you could possibly design a small add on board that will fit on the 4 Pin Header and the two mounting holes. This gives the design extreme flexibility.        In the initial prototype we had only 3 Pin. We had earlier assumed that the power supply was not required, which could have restricted the possibility of having an active add on board.    Background   The hubpixed was first announced on January 24, 2016 in a  referencedesigner blog  and was subsequently  posted on kickstarter . Hubpixed was first of its kind product and was subsequently updated to include a wifi ( in HubPiWi ) and a Wifi and a Bluetooth ( in HubPiWi Blue). The launch of the Raspberry Pi Zero W made the later two product redundant as Pi Zero W included in built Wifi and Bluetooth.   Similar products were launched later on, however, our product still beats them in terms of design ( we have empty space in the 40 Pin Connector area) and price - Even with the USB UART functionality included our price is $10 in single quantity.    Our Earlier Similar Projects on Kickstarter    1. Pi Serialixed    PiSerialixed  is a UART to USB board that seamlessly connects to RPi allowing you to see the console messages and the login through the console to control the Raspberry Pi 3. This avoids the need to use an HDMI TV and Keyboard.   2. Notixed   Notixed is very similar to the PiSerialized project. It turns Pi Zero into a USB devices - without the need of a cable or connector. Just hook notixed with Pi Zero with the 4 provided screws.  It was successfully backed by 291 backers and  raised $3,711 on kickstarter .     3. Hubpixed   Hubpixed is a 4 Port USB 2.0 Hub that will seamlessly connect to Raspberry Pi Zero without any connector. The novel idea uses the pogo pins. The hubpixed has been updated to support the latest Pi Zero 1.3 and Pi Zero W. It raised   $3194 from 125 backers on kickstarter .   4. HubPiWi and HubPiWi Blue   The HubPiWi extends the functionality of Hubpixed to include a Wifi on Hubpixed. The HubPiWi Blue extends a WIfi and a Bluetooth. HubPiWi had 149 backers and HubPiWi Blue had 553 backers.      Risks and challenges  With the successful history of product delivery we have mastered the art of production stages and gained confidence over it.   The risk therefore is a question of ""when the product will be delivered"" and not ""if the product will be delivered""."

There is no chance of electric shock, risk of fire, or harmful electromagnetic waves.   Previous similar products could not function with the 5V power bank (battery pack) of normal cell phones and had low heat efficiency, which allowed warming of only a small area. There was much demand for the previous heating blankets but due to raw materials and technology, they were never commercialized. But the Radishine comforter activates with a normal cell phone power bank (battery pack, 5V. 2.1A) and releases far-infrared radiation when turned on. Radiance SFIM is an advanced technology that allows far-infrared radiation to soak deep in to the skin and allows coziness and warmness to spread to the body, giving a warm and comfortable feeling.       ÃÂÃÂ When you cover yourself with a Radishine, you will definitely experience the solar heat that is founded on  SFIM technology  permeating through your body snugly.

Beginning from research to secure food resources inside a spaceship, far-infrared ray studies have developed mostly for medical purposes. It is an effective light that is regarded as an elixir of life, effective in treating cancer and preventing aging.       Radiant Heat  Sunlight is the source of the radiant heat that we experience every day in our lives. You may recall being out in the sun and suddenly experiencing a cooling-down feeling when clouds hid sun. The reason we feel this change in temperature immediately, even though there wasnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t enough time for the air temperature to decrease, is because the clouds blocked the sunÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s infrared radiation from reaching our bodies. The heat from the infrared radiation is similar to the sunÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s heat, as well as the heat that our bodies generate by burning calories from food to keep ourselves warm. Radiant heat has excellent storage, making it effective for winter heating.       ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   The benefits of far-infrared radiationÃÂÃÂ   The typical effect of far-infrared radiation generating a heat reaction after being absorbed into our bodies is enlarging our capillaries, encouraging blood circulation and cellular tissue growth. Also, when the heat reaches the moisture and protein molecules that make up the cells, it shakes the cells 2,000 times per minute. This vitalizes the cellular tissues, helping to prevent aging, boosting metabolism, increasing tissue regeneration, and preventing adult diseases such as chronic fatigue.       ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ    The far-infrared ray from sunlight  ÃÂÃÂ   Far-infared ray emitted from the SFIM is the currently the only technology known to mankind that contains the same universe energy found in the sun's far-infrared ray. Far-infrared ray is a heat-generation and transfer technology. When the heating element (heating wire) consumes 1KW electricity, this electrical energy is changed into a wavelength of light(far-infrared ray) and travels 360 degrees out of the heating element at the speed of light. This wavelength is then absorbed into the object, creating vibrations (resonance) inside the object that is reverted again into heat. The heating effects of this technology depends on how efficiently the electrical energy can be changed into the wavelength of light(far-infrared), how far the changed wavelength can travel, how well this wavelength can be absorbed into the object, and how much the wavelength can be reverted to heat after being absorbed. Efficient performance of this wavelength is called the degree of activation in far-infrared. The wavelength with the greatest degree of far-infrared activation is the far-infrared ray emitted from the sun. The suns' far-infrared is presumed to contain an energy (tentatively named 'universe energy') that cannot be explained by any physics theory or law that mankind has developed. Utilizing this far-infrared ray that holds the universe energy and applying it to all the areas where humans need heat will revolutionize our heating paradigm.       ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ   Conventional heating productsÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> far-infrared vs. RadishineÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s far-infrared  Conventional heating/steaming and thermal equipment has weak or temporary far-infrared effects (weak penetration, short distance, etc.). The heat cannot reach over 1cm under the skin so that it has less therapeutic effect.Most heating/steaming and thermal equipment needs to be applied for at least 30 minutes to warm the muscle tissue by raising its temperature by 1 degree. Such a long exposure to heat may cause burns.The far-infrared heat of Radishine permeates deeply into muscle and bone tissues, perfectly achieving the far-infrared effect of the sun discovered by NASA. Radishine is the only product that can bring real therapeutic effects such as relaxation of muscle pain, improvements of blood circulation, and enhancement of the immune system.       ÃÂÃÂ        Smart Heating Algorithm for the perfect Sleep  Years of R&amp;D went into making sure Radishine is able to have an advanced technology that can make peopleÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s better sleep possible using a smart heating algorithm. Radiance uses three astonishing technologies to develop such a result. The first technology is the far-infrared heat that permeates deeply into the muscle and bone tissues perfectly achieving the effect of the sun as discovered by NASA. Second, we maximized the best sleep environment by making it possible to apply different levels of heat at different parts of oneÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s body using heat circulation system. Last but not least, we have optimized the best temperature settings based on years of our own analytics.ÃÂÃÂ        1)The far-infrared heat of Radishine permeates deeply into muscle and bone tissues, perfectly achieving the far-infrared effect of the sun proven by NASA  2) Maximize the best sleep environment by sending heat to the different parts of your body by heat circulationÃÂÃÂ     3) Optimized temperature settings based on years of analyticsÃÂÃÂ ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> Study:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18192289         Rapid heat-generating technology ÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ         At the center of RadishineÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s technology are ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>new composite heat materialsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ that can generate heat instantly. A Radishine comforter can control its heat production rate by turning on and off every second based on different levels of settings that one would want. This remarkable process can avoid not only excessively building up heat, but also magnificently saves energy.  Heat Circulation  RadishineÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s heat-circulating technology has been designed to apply healthy heat effects to the human body by low power energy. The human body has a distinct feature in that it tries to maintain homeostasis. Therefore, Radishine conducts heat indirectly to the whole body by using a remarkable method that applies heat at certain parts of the body to let oneÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s warmed up bloodstream spread out.       ÃÂÃÂ Starting with this fundamental principle, the heat circulation technology has made it possible to pull out heat by circulating it through different circuits that have been divided into shoulder, belly, leg, or even upper and lower parts of your body. This crucial difference has given Radishine its advantages, such as saving about 1/3~1/6 of the energy by not spreading heat over the whole area at once. Moreover, whenever one is using a Radishine, it maintains the difference of your blood density consistently in the shoulder, belly, leg, or upper and lower parts of body. This process can have a positive effect on blood circulation, and at the same time you will experience the same effect as though you were bathing your lower half. Repetition of this remarkable process is designed to make you peacefully fall into a sound sleep by maximizing the comfortableness all over your body as time goes by.  Upper &amp; Lower Body Division   Temperature settings can be adjusted separately for the upper and lower body. Keep your feet and other extremities warm by increasing blood circulation to the parts that need it.       Dual - Mode  RadiShine allows control over each partnerÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s bed temperature separately.ÃÂÃÂ         Sleep pattern Mode    In sleep mode, temperature settings are automatically regulated to encourage the three stages of sleep to match your circadian rhythm: falling asleep, deep slumber and before waking.       ÃÂÃÂ        RadishineÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s unbelievable heat effect is greatly expected to create several health benefits.  Without causing any side effects such as skin damage or low temperature burns, it is a technology that helps people to have sound sleep and build up their own health with true sleep. It is the beginning of a revolution in electronic exothermic bedding, which other people have failed to achieve due to limitations of technology until now.   A heat that is good for your health   Heat has great benefits such as increasing the level of blood flow all over the body and creating a fast metabolism that results in relaxation of muscle tension. We use ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>heatÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ for cancer treatment for setting a high value because of the fact that cancer cells are relatively weak against high temperature compared to normal cells. Moreover, when cells are exposed to high temperature, they die out due to the coagulation of necessary proteins. Therefore, we can keep our eye on the power of heat as a treatment for almost any incurable disease.   Radishine: An ideal future healthy sleeping technology   Radishine is the true definition of ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>the science of sleep.ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ and it can help people to have sound sleep and promote their healthÃÂÃÂ      Improvement of natural healing(recovery) power and immunity in human body   A sound nightÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s sleep is known to strengthen the human bodyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s innate natural healing (recovery) power and immune system. Therefore, sleeping is very important for humans. The key to health improvement is how we fall asleep, which refers to how long we experience deep, comfortable sleep (deep sleep). Radishine uses a combination of healthful light that penetrates into the muscles and bones through heating a composite element using a healthful heat algorithm and scientific circulatory heating therapy technology, thereby inducing a sound sleep. Radishine, true bedding, will generate comfortable warmth and provide an experience of bed science and of a soft mattress cushion, so that you can fall into deep sleep. During a comfortable and deep sleep with Radishine, the human bodyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s natural healing (recovery) power and immunity will be strengthened, resulting in a natural improvement of health.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        What is SFIM?   SFIM(SUHO Far-Infrared heating wire composite material), the core technology of Radiance, is a heat-generating new material and releases a special far-infrared ray. Far-infared ray is a new type of infrared radiation that NASA discovered. The typical effect of far-infrared ray generating a heat reaction after being absorbed into our bodies, is enlarging our capillaries, encouraging blood circulation and cellular tissue growth. Also, when the heat reaches the moisture and protein molecules that make up the cells, it shakes the cells 2,000 times per minute. This vitalizes the cellular tissues, helping to prevent aging, boost metabolism, increasing tissue regeneration, and preventing adult diseases such as chronic fatigue. Other benefits include pain reduction, removal of heavy metal particles, deodorization, mold-repelling, dehumidification, and air cleaning, making it useful as medical equipment, kitchen equipment, housing and building materials, textiles, bedding, etc. SFIM is the world's first far-infrared ray containing energy of universe.       ÃÂÃÂ Key technologyÃÂÃÂ    Resistance suppression technology targeting the electricity skin effect  Kinetic energy controlling technology on inner parts of atoms forming hot wire (resistance) moleculesÃÂÃÂ   Electric dipole moment controlling technology targeting atoms when we conduct electricity through hot wire (resistance)    Content of technology and effectivenessÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ     With the repetition of nuclear spin conversion, it increases the speed and the number of times collisions occur between nuclear and a free electrons even higher than the JouleÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s Law caloric value. Moreover, even with a tiny bit of electric flow, the hot wire reacts sensitively, which allows high-speed and high-temperature heating to happen. This technology increases energy efficiency by using ewer resources and getting a great outcome.   Through changing an electric dipole momentÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s size and position, one can release great quantity of far-infrared radiation. At the same time, it holds nuclear spin energyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s movement back, which can let far-infrared radiation include intensive dark energy that flies off to a great distance.   Due to all the above principles, a movement that reacts sensitively toward electric flow creates strong heating under voltage electricity (1V~24V). In particular, this technology activates strong heating reaction on DC current even at the photovoltaic modules (DC 1V~24V). These technologies can be merged with a photovoltaic system and open the way to a new generation of technology by fulfilling zero energy consumption goals associated with any field that needs heat.ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Extra fine heat wire ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> No wire felt through the fabric and no jab-in-the-rib  The bedding a person lies on or covers him or herself with when sleeping should be soft, give a feeling of coziness, and induce better sleep. In this context, bed manufacturers are developing beds and mattress cushions in a process they call ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>bed science,ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ which incorporates state-of-art technologies. In this way, they compete in the field of high-performance cushion technology.ÃÂÃÂ        However, conventional electric heated bedding have technological constraints that only result in the manufacturing of products with low flexibility. This is because conventional electric heated bedding apply inferior (in terms of tensile strength and durability, etc.) electric heat wire element technology, making electrical heated bedding difficult to bend, stiff, and thick(to prevent a short-circuit caused by bending and folding of internal electrical heat wire). Furthermore, non-bending, stiff, and thick conventional electric heated bedding with low flexibility also pose a problem in the fact that the unique, high-performance, cushiony feel of high-end and high-performance beds is lost when they are placed on beds made with cutting-edge technology. As a result, conventional electric heated bedding has very low flexibility and cannot be called genuine heating bedding synonymous with softness and coziness. Radishine has resolved these problems by adopting SFIM heating composite material, which causes no safety problems even when the blanket/comforter is rolled or folded completely.        RadishineÃÂÃÂ          Conventional heated blanket          Wireless + Compatibility (any type of 5V USB batteries) ex) power bank, battery pack, etc.   No need for an outlet, an external battery pack keeps Radishine wireless and portable.There is no risk of electric shock, fire or harmful electromagnetic wave exposure. Capable of being powered by any 5V external battery (power bank), Radishine comforter offers unparalleled heating efficiency. To ensure that consumers can use heat bedding more conveniently, compatibility should be assured with various products that are commercially marketed and very easily available. In this smart phone era, compatibility is important for products standardized with DC 5V (2.1A output), which are available anywhere. Radishine is a convenient and safe product compatible with any components such as a DC 5V(2.1A output) battery, auxiliary battery, power bank, power bank auxiliary battery, battery pack, energy storage devices(ESS), and portable DC power supplies, etc., which differs from device that work by plugging a power cord into an AC 110-220V in combination with bedding such as ordinary electric blanket/pad, etc.ÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ   Queen Size ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094> 5V, 2.1A output, 2 USB ports (2.1A each)ÃÂÃÂ   Twin Size ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094> 5V, 2.1A output, 1 USB port  *Battery not included  3-Safe TECHNOLOGY  Fire/Electric Shock/Electromagnetic Wave  The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), under the umbrella of the World Health Organization (WHO), classified the extremely low frequencies generated from high-voltage transmission lines and household electrical appliances as Group 2B carcinogens in 1999. In addition, the IARC also classified microwave emissions from mobile phones and mobile communication facilities as Group B2 carcinogens in 2011. Electric blankets operating at AC 110V/220V and the household electrical appliances that use an alternating current as mentioned above are all categorized as Group B2 carcinogens using an extremely low frequency (50-60Hz). In particular, electromagnetic waves from electric blankets are in close proximity to the human body for 8 hours while sleeping, which is pretty scary.         The electromagnetic waves from extremely low frequency products are reduced to 1/100 even when the distance is more than 30cm. Electric blankets that use DC low-voltage electric power without harmful electromagnetic waves are good. However, not many DC mats have been put on the market for the following reasons. Based on AC 220V (alternating current), products operating at voltages below DC 24V (direct current) should generate heat with about 1/10 of the voltage. To generate heat with a voltage below DC 24V, the heat wire must, theoretically, be thick, or the current must be amplified to provide sufficient heat output. Higher currents make it very difficult to control. When a high electrical current is used, local overheating, or a blow phenomenon, will result from even a slightly insufficient capacity of heat wire or from any change in the resistance of the resistor due to folding or breaking of the heat wire. Consequently, local overheating will cause problems in the part concerned, which is very likely to lead to a fire. Various products containing carbon heat wire or charcoal heat wire, etc., are typical examples of hazards. Heat wire materials are coated with carbon, not metal. Therefore, prolonged use or folding or bending will result in cracked coating and local overheating, increasing the risk of fire constantly.        Therefore, local overheating cannot be resolved unless the heat wires are made from highly durable metal. Therefore, the currently marketed blanket products operating at voltages below DC 24V, which are unable to control a high current easily, have two major problems, as below: a) Poor heating performance - As it is difficult to control a high current, only a low current is applied without embedding many wires that make the power necessary for heating. b) Fire hazard - With a high current, heat can be generated well. However, folding or bending the mat or using it without care is very likely to increase the risk of fire over the long-term due to the high current. To overcome the problems of products operating at voltages below DC 24V, it is necessary to combine technologies, such as precisely thermally adjustable metal heat wire technology, heat technology enabling instantaneous heating and maintenance of constant temperature, and algorithm technology capable of precisely controlling the current. Only then will it be possible to make an electric blanket operating at voltages below DC 24V without harmful electromagnetic waves.    Electromagnetic Wave Test #1 Radishine tests negative for electromagnetic wave emission even when heating. The reading shows the same numerical value both before and after Radishine is in use.        Electromagnetic wave test #2  The left one is Radishine the right one is a conventional heated blanket.       Radishine is operated by DC 5V battery pack and has no harmful electromagnetic waves. The conventional one shows high numerical values.     Advantages of Radishine     Radishine, by adopting a new advanced heating element alloy, has achieved precision, durability, ultra-fast heat generation, and the self-regulating ability to maintain temperature uniformly by the heat wire itself. Moreover, Radishine divides a large area to be heated into several circuits and controls them based on a circular heat generation algorithm to prevent any flow of excessive current to each part with high precision. Regarding these non-simple heating products and heat wires, Radishine developed by Radiance, represents the culmination of decades of scientific research and experiments. It removes concerns about harmful electromagnetic waves and fire/electric shock hazards. More importantly, Radishine which emits true far-infrared radiation (verified by various reports and agricultural and architectural fields, etc.) is expected to have beneficial effects on health, unlike existing products. Radishine is a product of science that facilitates sound sleep and promotes health.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ     Certified Anti-Bacterial     Sewn from an eco-friendly, natural fabric extracted from beech trees, RadiShineÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s materials and SUHO far infrared heat technology synergize to create certified antibacterial protection that even blocks allergens and dust mites.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ          ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        Extra power saving : 10.5W for the single size and 21W for the queen size ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> Save your electricity billÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ   *Based on output mAh *Batteries Not IncludedÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ          ÃÂÃÂ          Laundry safe and easy to use   Radishine is slim and flexible, allowing regular machine washesthat ensure a semi-permanent life span.Extremely durable with no risk of electric shock,you can fold or wrinkle Radishine for storage, and also spin dry with no worries.

All the way since our first Kickstarter campaign to today. We commit to deliver the Rubbee X in time for the next riding season.            Combined, our team has over 40 years of experience in development and manufacturing of electric vehicles. We've worked on multiple hybrid electric trucks, charging stations, electric cars and, of course - Rubbee itself. So when it comes to engineering - we've got what it takes.       We used to manufacture all the previous generation Rubbee units in our own assembly line in Lithuania. Now we're gearing up for a much larger scale of manufacturing. So from the very beginning we've developed Rubbee X in close partnership with a solid manufacturing partner. Hint - they employ over 2500 people. They are huge ! This ensures quality, smooth certification process and great after sales support.       For the past year we've been working on our next-gen electronics, new motor, batteries and other new components of the Rubbee X. It's a product we've developed from the ground up with all our knowledge from the previous generations of it. We've built multiple prototypes along the way, here are some moments of our journey and a short video about how the earlier prototypes of Rubbee X works:ÃÂÃÂ               You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

We are proud to introduce PAL, or Portable Adaptive Lighting - a powerful and rugged light that pairs with accessories to deliver illumination wherever its needed. Whether you use it on its own or you pair it with an accessory, PAL is designed to perform among the best in class.ÃÂÃÂ   HERE IS HOW IT WORKS.       Our modular connection allows for easy one-handed operation - creating the ability to customize your lighting based on your active lifestyle.  The basis for the modular connection is rooted in reliability and utility. We needed to find a way to securely attach the light to an accessory while still maintaining smooth and easy operation.       STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED - LIMITED EDITION COLORED PAL       FEATURED IN.       HERE ARE THE FEATURES.       ÃÂÃÂ         SMALL BUT POWERFUL.       ÃÂÃÂ TECHNICAL SPECS.       ACCESSORIES FOR UNLIMITED UTILITY.  By pairing with a suite of compatible accessories, PAL can transform into the perfect light for all of your needs. With accessories that provide access to ambient lighting, task lighting and mobile lighting, we have a solution that will enable you to maximize your time spent outdoors at night.       ÃÂÃÂ PAL IN ACTION.       Our patented attachment system uses opposing magnetic poles to seamlessly rotate PAL into a secure mechanical and electrical* connection with its accessories.ÃÂÃÂ        DESIGNED WITH YOU IN MIND.  All personal lighting products are different - different brands, different battery sizes, different applications...and since we all have different needs, we found ourselves with an unnecessary number of personal lighting products.   We were frustrated - and we couldn't find a solution that would provide us with reliable access to light in all conditions...so we set out to develop the perfect light for every application.  After countless hours of design, several prototype iterations, and long debates about user interaction, we developed a simple and intuitive solution - a modular light with the functional utility that allows precise access to light for a limitless number of activities.        PERFECTING A MODULAR LIGHTING SYSTEM AS VERSATILE AS OUR LIVES.   We teamed with the best and brightest designers and engineers to develop a lighting system that could match our needs. We spent countless hours exploring various form factors, connection methods, and user interactions. After relentless iteration and prototyping, we developed a one-handed modular system that is just as relevant in the home as it is in the outdoors.        A CLOSER LOOK.       No more fumbling with a single button - we simplified the interaction with tactile buttons that each serve a purpose.ÃÂÃÂ      use PAL with the flashlight handle for a range of activities, and to recharge PAL.    ÃÂÃÂ      use PAL as a headlamp for hands free illumination    ÃÂÃÂ      take PAL on a ride by pairing it with the bike mount.    ÃÂÃÂ      use PAL with the lantern accessory for ambient lighting.    ÃÂÃÂ      use PAL with the task arm accessory to access focused light.    ÃÂÃÂ      use the flashlight handle accessory to recharge PAL and other devices on the go.    THE TEAM BEHIND THE DREAM.  We believe that everyone has a duality to their lives - an urban side where we live and work, and a wild side that longs to be outdoors. We strive to help people bridge this gap between urban and wild by enabling them to get out and explore, even after the sun goes down.ÃÂÃÂ        Chris and Derek are brothers-in-law with a common passion for travel and adventure, always lookingfor new experiences and challenges.

The power to the Raspberry Pi is supplied by the Pi On/Off jumper which can be left in the off position and power used from the USB Out and Terminal Block. The second Pi18650 DUAL Battery HAT can have the Pi On/Off jumper in the On position powering the Pi and also powering devices from the USB Out and Terminal Block.  NEW!!! Arduno UNO Adapter Board  We have made a quick design of an adapter board for the Arduino UNO so that Arduino users can take advantage of the Pi18650 DUAL HAT and interface to their projects and applications. Prototypes PCB's will be ordered shortly and new perks coming soon. In the layout below the Pi18650 DUAL HAT will piggyback on top of this board which will plug into the Arduino UNO headers. Power is provided to the Vin pin on the UNO board.     Pi18650 Arduino Adapter Board    Pi18650 History  Recently in our latest Kickstarter campaign we brought you the Pi18650 HAT which provided battery power and UPS capabilities for your Raspberry Pi and we thank all of our supporters for bringing it to life. There are millions of Raspberry Pi's out there used in all kinds of applications from camera security systems, robotics to automation and control. We have helped power Pi's in remote applications integrated with PLC's along with maker projects and upcoming products. The Raspberry Pi is an exceptional product which has penetrated various markets and helped many people and customers learn new skills in programming and hardware. The Raspberry Pi Os is imaged on an SD card which are known to be very volatile when not properly shutdown like any ordinary computer and can be corrupted in a short period of time due to power spikes and brownouts in the electrical grid. The Pi18650 DUAL BATTERY HAT provides a battery backup system (UPS) when tethered to a USB power source. When power is lost or interrupted, the batteries kick-in allowing the Pi to run seamlessly. A battery monitoring script written in Python provides a proper shutdown procedures when the batteries are running low on power. The Pi18650 DUAL BATTERY HATÃÂÃÂ also allows the Pi to run for extended periods of time when not connected to a USB power supply. Great for those remote and outdoor applications or where no power outlets are available. ÃÂÃÂ   What is the Pi18650 DUAL BATTERY HAT  The Pi18650 is an add on HAT which plugs into the 26/40 pin connector on the Raspberry Pi. This HAT allows you to operate your Raspberry Pi without a power cable and can use various capacity 18650 Lithium Ion batteries. On board are two 1A battery charging circuits for charging the batteries individually. The Pi18650 development board also includes a 4x2 100mil header for use with a ESP8266 (ESP-01) wifi module for remote monitoring and CLOUD integration or a custom designed board. Included is one additional stacking header for extra clearance when stacking other HAT's on top of the Pi18650 DUAL BATTERY HAT.How Long Can The Pi Last?As an example the Raspberry Pi Zero uses approximately 87mA without and 103mA with a USB dongle plugged in. With a fully charged single 3000mAh battery, the Pi would last 34.5 Hrs with nothing attached. Using two batteries would double the run time.ÃÂÃÂ   The Pi18650 DUAL BATTERY HAT has additional features added to the single battery version. As with two batteries the design becomes more complex and we have added an LED indicator to show the battery has power and connected to the load. A comparator circuit monitors the battery voltage level and when it gets too low it will be automatically cut off from the load with a small current drain on the battery giving it longer standby time before being recharged or replaced. The batteries can be swapped on the fly by the user.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   How it works?  The Pi18650 DUAL BATTERY HAT holds two single cell lithium Ion 18650 form factor batteries which should have integrated battery protection circuits. The boost circuit maintains the voltage to the Pi at 5.1V for battery voltages of 3.7V to 4.2V. The jumper allows you to disable power to the Pi and Isolate the battery circuit or start the Pi. This jumper can be used with an external relay providing automatic control from circuit or system. It also includes two charging IC's which can charge up to 1A from the USB Micro connector and has two battery monitoring IC's which communicates to the Pi via I2C.

Facilities will include a main parking lot, an information booth with maps, WiFi credentials, local businesses, and rules for the campground. Paths to each campsite begin at the main entrance. No-potable water on premises.   What Will We Use for Restrooms?   We are hiring a local portable toilet service to provide regularly cleaned facilities throughout the entire season. These are easier on the environment and guarantee regular maintenance.   How Will We Monitor Camper Safety?   Like campgrounds found in the national parks and national forests, Pocket Parks are camp-at-your-own-risk campgrounds. We provide tools to assist campers in their experience including water for campfires, WiFi for connectivity, and information on local emergency services. Additionally, solar/battery powered cellular security cameras provide constant visual surveillance on key locations throughout the campground.   Can I Bring My Dog?   Yes, we love dogs! Please bring food and drinkable water for your pup. We have food and water bowls at each campsite and paw-friendly paths. Dog owners are asked to keep furry friends on a 6 foot leash and respect quiet hours for other guests.   Can I Bring My RV?   The layout, amenities, and lack of through roads make Pocket Parks a tent camping only campground.   Do We Have Group Camping Sites?

Its development over time has been dominated by the one-run world of ski racing and less by the needs of the everyday skier or snowboarder.  In the 1980s, again driven by racingÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s desire for speed in small doses, dangerous perfluorocarbons and other toxic chemical additives were included in wax recipes to broaden performance and increase operational temperature ranges. Wax still depends on the need for the inconvenient and constant reapplication of chemical functional groups that cause widespread damage to the environment and those applying it.            Phantom is a permanent, one-time application base-coating that forever eliminates the need for waxing skis and snowboards.   ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a disruptive, truly innovative solution that ushers in a new era in snowsports.ÃÂÃÂ     PhantomÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s patent-pending polymer technology offers ultimate convenience combined with great glide performance that never wanes across all snow temperatures, and for the life of a ski or boardÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s use.ÃÂÃÂ   Phantom eliminates the damage traditional wax does to watersheds, along with the health risks for people applying it.ÃÂÃÂ   Phantom can be applied to any new or used ski or snowboard at any point in a boardÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s life cycle, at a price that quickly delivers strong value.            With a single and permanent application, you get ultimate convenience (no waxing required), elite-level performance, substantial cost savings (no regular waxings), increased base durability, while saying no to the harmful chemical waste found in traditional ski and snowboard waxes.            When you wax a ski or snowboard, enhanced glide is evident for a few hours (soybased waxes) or a few days at best (hot-boxed temperature specific waxes). Wax is an inherently soft topical layer that quickly wears off of base material due to ongoing friction with the snow surface. If regular waxing routines are missed, performance and glide drops drastically. Because waxing is time consuming, itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s rarely done with regularity.ÃÂÃÂ   PhantomÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s sophisticated, timed polymerization process permanently penetrates the entire thickness of the base material with powerful go-fast fluoro compositions designed to operate across all snow temperatures. When the ski or snowboard goes into a shop for stone grinding, the next fresh layer of Phantom is exposed ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> ready to glide.ÃÂÃÂ             Unless you are constantly waxing with the correct temperature specific waxes, Phantom is faster across all conditions over time because its performance is consistent: you never suffer the glide degradation that happens when wax starts to quickly wear away.       As skiers and snowboarders who regularly ride at the resort or in the backcountry, we arenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t looking to win races. We desire reliable and predictable glide in all snow conditions and terrain.ÃÂÃÂ   Tested in different snow climates around the globe, and backed by extensive lab data, Phantom is noticeably faster than all-temperature wax in warm snow temperatures, and provides similar levels of glide in colder snow temperature ranges.ÃÂÃÂ        Phantom has a characteristic feel: when initially pushing off, or in a lift line, there is nothing distinctive or special. A Phantomed base doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t have the slippery feel of fresh wax when moving very slowly. However, after gaining just a little bit of speed, Phantom delivers significant acceleration and achieves strong top-end glide, run after run.ÃÂÃÂ   Phantom also permanently alters the shore hardness of the base material itself; durability and resilience against rock impact increase ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> permanently.                 The innovation centers around the inclusion of glide friendly fluorocarbon functional groups, but in a superior, new delivery method that renders them inert and harmless to life. Phantom doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t cause biological damage, and doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t present any long term environmental risks.ÃÂÃÂ   Traditional hydrocarbon wax can contain environmentally dangerous, cancer causing chemicals such as: acetone, benzene, 2-butanone (methyl ethyl ketone), carbon disulfide, carbon tetrachloride, cresol, chlorobenzene, carbon monoxide, cyclopentene, ethyl benzene, mercury, styrene, tetrachloroethene, toluene, and xylene.ÃÂÃÂ        The dangers of wax begin during factory production where chemicals can seep into the surrounding watershed.ÃÂÃÂ   It then extends to those who apply wax in a shop or home environment. If you have ever seen images of world cup tuners applying fluorinated waxes with masks straight out of a nuclear fallout, you now may have an idea why. Even with non-flourinated waxes, toxin-laden fumes are inhaled into the lungs during the application process. Studies in Norway and Sweden have shown that technicians carry extremely high levels of perfluorochemicals (PFCs) and other chemicals found in ski wax in their bloodstreams. PFOA, for example, has been shown to be 45 times that of the general population, and is a direct catalyst to cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and hormone irregularities. Phantom eliminates the nasty chemical risk for shop technicians.  Wax damage then spreads globally when a ski or snowboard is ridden down the mountain. Because wax is inherently softer than base material, friction from snow causes it to shed into the ecosystem during the use/degradation process (the reason you have to constantly reapply wax). You can see this effect on a warm day when the snow beneath your boards turns the color of your wax. When springtime arrives, wax flows into streams, rivers, and soil. Toxic chemicals then react with organic systems: fish, land animals, plants, and human drinking water are all subject to reactions that create permanent free radical damage. Worse yet, PFCs are indestructible and proliferate indefinitely throughout the ecosystem, causing ongoing damage to life.ÃÂÃÂ        Some manufacturers with an interest in sustainability have developed soy-based wax alternatives, but these waxes only last for a few runs and do not have the effective operating temperature range performance that can be achieved with the inclusion of harmful chemicals. The performance is simply not there.ÃÂÃÂ   Phantom upends this whole narrative, and presents a clean future for snowsports while delivering both performance and convenience.            PhantomÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s approach is a truly innovative, advanced scientific advancement. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a recipe that works day after day, tune after tune, and forever fundamentally changes our conception and approach to fast running boards designed for daily use.  DPS examined a history of alternative approaches that attempted to solve the wax problem, but nothing was deemed competitive. The Company then began a developmental relationship with a group of leading material scientists to research and attack the problem via a novel polymerization approach.ÃÂÃÂ   Initial Phantom research and development went through over forty different compound variations and extensive validation in both the lab and the mountains of Utah, Chile, and New Zealand to come to the formula.ÃÂÃÂ        Lab results that have correlated the hydrophobicity, coefficient of friction, shore hardness and full base penetration sit in harmony with test ski days in every condition: from manmade snow, warm spring snow, to fresh powder.ÃÂÃÂ                           Risks and challenges  DPS has been designing and launching snowsports products for over a decade.

ÃÂÃÂ        Following the success of HomeBiogas1.0, we have developed a new biogas appliance that will enable families around the world to cook on renewable energy. The HomeBiogas 2.0 is the most efficient, affordable and rewarding way to transform food waste and animal manure into energy in your own backyard!     Got 30 seconds? Here's how the HomeBiogas 2.0 appliance can benefit you:         ÃÂÃÂ        New to Biogas? Great! Learning how to make your own renewable energy from food waste is a fascinating and truly rewarding journey. We designed HomeBiogas 2.0 to be super simple and easy to use.ÃÂÃÂ  Just toss in your organic waste, and the bacteria will do the rest. Here are the basics of how it works:       ÃÂÃÂ Leftover food or food scraps may not be suitable for eating, but they still have calories that can be used to create energy. So don't throw them out! Put food waste or animal manure into the appliance. The bacteria in the digester will break down the organic matter and convert it into biogas and fertilizer.ÃÂÃÂ The gas bag holds 700 liters of biogas at all times, ready for all your cooking needs. It is a 100% off-the-grid and natural process, similar to what happens in your own stomach.   WATCH: The fascinating process in 10 seconds!        ÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ     ÃÂÃÂ          COOKING WITH YOUR FOOD WASTE   Feed your food waste to HomeBiogas 2.0 and get up to 3 hours of cooking gas daily. It looks, smells, and burns just like any traditional gas would, the only difference is that this gas is made from recycling in your own backyard!       ÃÂÃÂ    HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID FERTILIZER   The other outcome is all high-quality liquid fertilizer. No mess or work needed. The fertilizer flows from the user-friendly pouring sleeve straight into your fertilizer can. You will be proud to nourish your plants and food garden with a  natural  product, free from harmful chemicals and additives!ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ    TEACH THE YOUNG GENERATION TO RECYCLE   HomeBiogas 2.0 enables households to embrace recycling and teach sustainable practices to the young generation. Education and leading by example are the most effective ways of creating new and positive habits. Imagine children growing up knowing that food scraps are not waste, they are valuable!ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Choose a location in your backyard for HomeBiogas 2.0. It can be up to 20 meters from the kitchen. Then assemble it by connecting a few parts and filling up the digester with water. Assembly is super easy and should only take an hour! After assembly, activate the appliance the old-fashioned way, using animal manure, or using a bacteria kit. Activation only needs to be done  one time , and once activation is done, you will be able to feed HomeBiogas 2.0 with your food scraps and produce free, renewable energy on a daily basis!       ÃÂÃÂ       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ Composting is certainly a good step in the right direction, but with HomeBiogas, you can get more out of your waste. Unsure about why HomeBiogas is the future of waste composting? Let us show you:       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ  Appliance Features:        ÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ       HomeBiogas 2.0 is a powerful tool that can help mitigate climate change! It is an off-the-grid appliance, meaning that it does not depend on the use of any non-renewable power source. There are several ways in which HomeBiogas 2.0 reduces greenhouse gas emissions.    DIVERTS WASTE FROM LANDFILLS   Local waste management with HomeBiogas 2.0 diverts food scraps from becoming landfill waste. When food goes to the landfill, the nutrients in the food never return to the soil. Rather, the wasted food rots and produces methane gas which is released into the atmosphere and contributes to global warming. When you use HomeBiogas 2.0 you will be recycling your food scraps in your own backyard and recycling the methane your food produces.       ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    REDUCES DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS   When you choose to cook on biogas that was made from your food waste, you are reducing the demand for fossil fuels, which are non-renewable resources. Mining, processing and transporting fossil fuels take a lot of energy and resources, which is harmful to the environment and is a leading contributor to climate change.        ÃÂÃÂ    SLOWS DOWN DEFORESTATION   Nearly 3 billion people around the world burn wood for daily cooking and heating. Burning wood releases emissions that are contributors to global climate change: carbon dioxide, methane and black carbon. Wood harvesting also contributes to loss of biodiversity and forest degradation. The use of biogas slows down this detrimental deforestation and gives an alternative to cooking on wood or charcoal.        ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ HomeBiogas 2.0 is our second model, the first one, HomeBiogas 1.0, was a huge success! Since its retail sales began in 2016, HomeBiogas 1.0 is used in 76 countries worldwide! Although our customers come from diverse cultures,  they share similar goals of wanting to reduce food waste and generate renewable energy.       ÃÂÃÂ        HomeBiogas is a socially oriented company that cares about spreading biogas technology to all. During the campaign, you can get involved too! WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve partnered with local organizations in Puerto Rico and in Kenya so that we can provide clean energy to the families who need it.

Contacto: nicole@homebiogas.com  ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ The Bio Toilet connects to the existing HomeBiogas 2.0 appliance to create cooking gas and fertilizer from human waste. The Bio Toilet is a low flush toilet (uses only 1.2 liters of water per flush), that does not require running water and can utilize grey water. The Bio Toilet is perfect for those wishing to live off-the-grid, and is a solution for underserved communities that do not have access to latrines. Just like HomeBiogas 2.0, the toilet will arrive in a small box, and has a simple do-it-yourself assembly. Multiple toilets have already been put into use, being tested both at the HomeBiogas headquarters and in the field. In 2018 it will be available as an accessory to HomeBiogas 2.0. Contact info@homebiogas.com to get more information.         ÃÂÃÂ Some pictures from the field:        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        We are 16 environmental enthusiasts who share core values and dream of make a meaningful change for the planet. We are passionate that backyard biogas production is the way of the future and an answer to so many global issues.  In the years to come, we will continue educating and pushing for our vision to enable biogas for all!ÃÂÃÂ  Thank you for supporting us and helping our dream become a reality!       ÃÂÃÂ  The Creation Process   In January 2017, we set out to improve the HomeBiogas appliance. We took all the feedback we got from existing customers using HomeBiogas 1.0 and worked to sharpen features and improve user experience. It was also very important for us to lower the production cost, so that we could get biogas technology to the people who need it the very most- those who still don't have a readily available, safe or affordable cooking source. We married theÃÂÃÂ science of biodigestion with a new and improved design, and in May 2017, we arrived at HomeBiogas 2.0.ÃÂÃÂ Our manufacturing partners are ready to go. All we need is your support so we can deliver this renewable energy generator to your door!

It's important to know that HomeBiogas 2.0 is nearly a finalized prototype. Currently, we have 10 systems working in the field in Beta testing. Our main challenge is to raise enough funds to jump-start our production line and deliver straight to your door.   We know that there are some unexpected hurdles when going to production. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why we have been working closely with suppliers and manufacturers to address those challenges head-on. We hope to stick to our timeline and so that we will not have shipping delays."

Kind of hard: wireless technology is amazing, and it has truly changed the way we lived over the past few years.       However, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve probably heard how a number of major scientific institutions around the world have raised alarms over the harmful effects of wireless radiation on our health. Over the last years, male fertility has been on the decline, and testicle cancer is one of the most frequent cancers of young men. If the debate on radiation is still opened, the Cleveland Clinic - the countryÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s leading center for clinical research in male fertility - found that men who keep their phones in their pocket for more than 4 hours per day experience a 50% reduction in sperm count!Here at SPARTAN, we didnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t want to this to threaten our modern life. We want to keep using technology without changing any of our habits. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why we have created the SPARTAN Boxers.       The SPARTAN Boxer is the boxer of the future. For the first time, we are bringing together design with innovation to create underwear that shields your family jewels from wireless radiation.       With SPARTAN, you just have to put on your comfy underwear in the morning to happily use your smartphone, tablet and computer with all the peace of mind of knowing your manhood and most important assets are safe.       WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re bringing to underwear the same advanced technology used in space suits (no kidding!). We developed a unique technology, WaveTech, a high-tech fabric incorporating pure silver fibers within the cotton of the boxer.WaveTech acts as a faraday cage (or electromagnetic shielding), which prevents radiation from reaching your cherries. Our SPARTAN Boxers have been tested by the MET Laboratory, Baltimore, USA and they block over 99% of all cellphone and Wi-Fi radiation.       The hard part when creating WaveTech was to manage to integrate the Silver Fiber in the cotton of the boxer without losing elasticity or creating a rigid fabric. We wanted to shield our little soldiers, but definitely not to wear armor. It took us months of work and hundreds of prototypes and different fabrics to get it just right, but we finally manage to create a fabric that is just as comfortable as your regular pair of undies.       The good news is that the silver it contains also makes SPARTAN boxers naturally anti-bacterial, so you and your downstairs area stay fresh at the end of the day. Stinky undies are already part of the past.       We know you want the best for your crown jewels. We sure do. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why we chose to design SPARTAN boxers in the Fashion Capital of the world: Paris, France.       Our stylists have been working with one clear goal in mind: surpass the level of comfort and style of the best undergarment already out there.With SPARTAN, we are truly raising the standard of male undergarment with high-quality French design for optimal comfort and an exceptional fit.       ÃÂÃÂ        Thousands of people in the world are already wearing SPARTAN but we are always hard at work to make SPARTAN even better.  We are now introducing new models with improved band and labels for more comfort, as well as new colors.  Going from Black and Blue, we are now introducing the very demanded Red, as well as Green and Grey.       Your favorite color is not in there? We would love to produce more, and have you vote for the colors YOU prefer. Keep an eye out for our stretched goals!       ÃÂÃÂ We have our final prototypes, and our manufacturers in Portugal are ready to get started. Everything is set and we can get started.  But in order to do this, we need to produce upfront an important quantity of fabric for each color. We cannot do this without you.We already have a good amount of our blue and black fabric, so we only need $2,000 to start the new collection. Each of our stretch goal will enable us to add a new color to the collection!  Here is what we need for each new color:       You will be asked for the colors and sizes you want at the end of the campaign, so that you can get the broadest choices possible depending on the goals we reach.  For the next few days, you have the opportunity to take part in the SPARTAN project and help us save humanity with boxers. For the occasion, we have created a Kickstarter-only price to help you get SPARTAN for yourself or your loved ones.       We are not a new company that will struggle to deliver, and we have got thousands of customers in the US and in over 20 countries.

Here are the main challenges we face:  Ship Date: We have built in extra time for the manufacturing process and we are confident we can deliver on time, but there is always a chance that things will take longer than planned.  Product changes:  As we refine our design based on additional community feedback, slight changes might be made such as a color change or more designs available.

Due to the technical difficulties of our new product, we had to make many changes to improve the quality of our cable, finding a willing factory to produce a prototype was extremely difficult.   Despite the challenges we had we finally completed of product, which was meticulously tested to ensure our product is running smoothly, our tests were aimed at: durability, external durability (such as skin tension, wear resistance, etc.), including the compatibility to the iPhone in the future. Our current challenge is that we can complete the fundraising, and how we can complete the mass production of our product and delivery them to our supporters at the exact time. If we complete the fund raising, we will make unscheduled visits to the factory and random quality checks to ensure the quality of our cables."

Thanks to its patented design and lightweight yet durable build, Notel allows you to easily and COMFORTABLY sleep in your vehicle. In minutes, you can go from commuting to comfortable sleep - with NOTEL.     Designed to operate easily in your vehicle    Our founder experienced the need for this product first hand while driving through the depths of Yellowstone National Park. He lost track of time as he ventured around the park enjoying the endless possibilities of exploration. Soon enough, he realized it was much too late to continue his drive past the park so he went on a wild search for a hotel room, with absolutely no luck. Not only could he not find a room, he also hadnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t thought to bring along a tent. That night he barely slept in the discomfort of his own car. In the midst of this sleepless night he came up with the idea for Notel.        Strap suspended system is fully adjustable, allowing for a completely flat surface, no matter the angle of the vehicleÃÂÃÂ   High density polyethylene sleeping surface is hydrophobic, protecting the system from the effects of moisture, spills, and damage from outdoor storageÃÂÃÂ   Comfortably sleeps any person in virtually any truck or SUVÃÂÃÂ   Lightweight telescoping aluminum frame supports flat sleeping surface and highly compatible storageÃÂÃÂ   Adaptability allows easy transfer between vehiclesÃÂÃÂ   Designed to securely install without any modifications to the vehicleÃÂÃÂ   Bonuses include: reduced camp set-up and take-down time, instant mobility, and protection from bugs, animals, and weather.ÃÂÃÂ   450 pound weight limit. Total weight of 32 pounds             This unique mobile sleeping system is great for many situations. The all-American outdoor experience was the idea of visionaries like President Theodore Roosevelt.  This campaign is an opportunity to promote and strengthen America's tradition of outdoor recreation on public lands. We hope to motivate more Americans to leave their homes for the wonders of nature, knowing they will remain comfortable and safe no matter the conditions. This 100% Made in America product is as much about the promise in the quality of our product as it is about the shared experiences being created when adventuring and enjoying the outdoors.  It is about making memories by taking the kids on a fishing trip, traveling, hiking, fishing, skiing, snowboarding, camping, beach excursions. Gaining independence, enjoying the freedom of nature without the risk and uncomforted insecurity and cost of hotel rooms. Taking the bugs, scary noises, and uncomfortable surfaces out of camping. Changing the way camping and traveling is experienced as we know it is what the Notel team is all about.            1. The passenger seat is reclined as far as possible with the headrest removed.  2. The aluminum frame is suspended and positioned above the passenger seat.  3. The polyethylene sleeping surface is attached to the aluminum frame.  4.

It worked nicely and we had many unforgettable parties around it! Since then my friend have been relentlessly asking me for their own table!  However, the table was very experimental and I spent a lot of money developing it with a lot of complex custom made printed circuit boards. While it was a lot of fun for me, people were surprised and not attracted by the overall cost of this project which was sad! While hardware was expensive, on the other hand I developed quite a bit of software to control the table creating a strong software core.       ÃÂÃÂ  I created the second prototype in 2015 when I moved to England. Well new house means new furniture =) This one was twice as big as the prototype, faster and cheaper, with more visual effects. I implemented the smartphone control and drastically decreased the building time.My new friends were amazed, and the requests to build more table were rushing once againÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦Seeing so much enthusiasm for my project drove me to go the extra mile and make my LED Table affordable.       This brings us to 2017. I decided to combine my willingness to bring this design to a larger audience, my drive for entrepreneurship and the appeal and interactivity of crowdfunding. My goal is to share the project around a community and see how far we can go together. This is why I focus so much on the sharing aspect of the effects/animation creation with  TheLEDTable.com .ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ We look forward to hearing your feedback! Thank you!      Risks and challenges  This is a very low risk project since the design is based on 2 mature prototypes that were tested for 4 years. The software is finished as well, with endurance testing. We know the table can run for months with no interruption.  The table was designed for fast and easy assembly, and I will be responsible for assembly so this part of the project is secure. All the electrical components are readily available with short lead time and multiple suppliers so this is not an issue as well.  Packaging and delivery are planned ahead. The table was designed to fit best packaging and the cost of delivery for all our target countries have been calculated. So no financial surprise here that could compromise the project."

This is where costs can add up quickly as additional fees can occur when redesigns and modifications are needed after test prints.

Formed from a single ring of LEDs rotating 15 times a second, Globe is a spherical display of over 491,000 pixels that can be viewed from all angles.  With a resolution of 1920x256 true colour pixel, a frame rate of 15Hz and a Raspberry Pi at its heart, Globe is capable of displaying images, video, games or anything else you could put on a traditional monitor.     Daytime over America    As a piece that draws the eye, Globe is perfect for artistic displays, as a platform for advertising or simply as a cool gadget.  ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ How it works (simple version)  Because of the persistence of vision effect, anything which comes into our vision remains there for about 1/10th to 1/15th of a second. It is this effect that allows us to write words with sparklers in the air, perform the ""bendy pencil"" trick and allowed CRT TVs and monitors to function.         Globe uses a circular disk with 256 RGB LEDs around the edge which is then spun about the Z axis. By changing the colour of each LED 1920 times every rotation, and rotating 15 times a second we can create a spherical display of 491,520 pixels.

An HDMI source generates the image data, an FPGA then buffers each image and distributes it to the appropriate LED driver.  For the in depth explanation as to how Globe works head on over to the  blog .       How can it be controlled and what can it be used for?  Globe will come with an Android and IOS app along with a straightforward web interface. You can then upload your own media or select from a range of prebuilt content to display; simply select the desired content and add it to the sequence.  GlobeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s pre-built content will allow you to display solar bodies such as Mars, Jupiter or even Ganymede, with their real time day &amp; night cycles.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   It will also be possible to overlay a range of meteorological and environmental data onto the earth, such as cloud cover, wind speed, air pressure, temperature, lightning strikes and earthquakes, as well as human influences like air and marine traffic, national borders, rocket launches and satellite positions.     Day/night sequence    As a particularly eye catching display coupled with the fact that it can be seen from all angles, Globe is perfect for advertising and artistic displays; by placing it in the center of a room you can be sure it will draw everyoneÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s gaze.

If you would like it to be set otherwise please add a note to your order.  ÃÂÃÂ Progress so far and work remaining  So far a proof of concept prototype has been built, clearing a large number of the hurdles in bringing Globe to life. This includes the vast bulk of the firmware coding, the majority of the PCB design and general mechanical design.   The next revision of the PCB design has been completed and is ready to be submitted for manufacture.    October - November:  Kickstarter Campaign    November - March:  Contract software development. Hardware development.    March - April:  Build pre-production prototype and finalise designs   April:  Order all components     May:  Assemble all Globes   June:  Quality control and safety testing   July:  Ship!       Risks and challenges  As with any startup venture there are associated risks which will need to be managed. The three key areas of risk are identified below along with the appropriate mitigating measures. 1.	Production times may slip: Each Globe is a fairly complex device consisting of multiple customised parts from different suppliers. Manufacturing delays for any of these parts may lead to delays in the assembly of the final units. To mitigate this potential risk I have selected reliable manufacturers for these bespoke components and have evaluated their reliability, turnaround and customer service during the creation of the prototype.  2. Demand could exceed my expectations: Although the first Kickstarter campaign has given me a pretty good idea of the demand, things may be different the second time around. If demand exceeds this then I am prepared. Quotes and delivery estimates for significantly more than the minimum funding target have been obtained from our chosen suppliers to allow us to maintain our shipping target dates even if demand is much higher than expected.  3. There may be unforeseen delays in the development process: So far I have built a working prototype, identified the future development work that needs to be conducted and devised an appropriate work plan with a reasonable margin in the timeline to accommodate the delays that traditionally crop up."

Having the drinking system with you on the trail now means having the booster with you as well. The booster without the bottle is very small and lightweight and fits into any backpack. Flat tubeless tire on the trail? Use a tubeless repair kit (like this for example), inflate your tire with the milKit booster, keep on riding.       ÃÂÃÂ        The milKit booster is a simple and inexpensive solution but the tools needed for the injection molding parts to produce the booster are still very expensive. The goal of this campaign is to get these tools pre-financed while delivering early access to quality tubeless installation tools to our supporters.   We will deliver to you a product that makes tubeless performance easily and cleanly available to more users. Please support us and help spread the word among your cycling friends by clicking the image below. LetÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s make tubeless easy - again!  ÃÂÃÂ          ÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ        The core technology of the milKit booster is the valve-actuated slider that releases the air directly into the valve stem. No hose. No additional valve. ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ   While the milKit booster is compatible with any tubeless tire valve, it works best with milKit tubeless valves. Because you remove the valve core before inflating tubeless tires (to achieve the highest possible air flow), a conventional tubeless valve does not act as a one-way valve anymore. The patented milKit valves have an additional rubber flap at the bottom that works as an additional one-way valve. Inflate the booster, press it on the valve, remove it, and your tires is installed. No hassle and no stress.  We have improved the milKit valves since our launch and they now include even more smart features.        ÃÂÃÂ        Smooth design and practical solutions are our mission ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> milKit was born out of a team of industrial designers and product developing engineers. Users loved the design of the milKit valve system and we are sure you will also like the design of the booster.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        When we faced the problem of having to inflate a tubeless tire during our holidays in a remote area we started to improvise and came up with a solution to replace the compressor temporarily. We inflated a PET drinking bottle and used the accumulated air to inflate our tire. Many people have built similar makeshift versions of tubeless inflators, like these:       While these are all creative masterpieces, we were looking for a safe and ready to use system out of the box. That's why we decided to build upon and refine this concept and turn it into a durable, professional quality product with additional features.ÃÂÃÂ        The milKit valve system solves a problem that we have experienced for years and wanted to find a solution for: you never really know how much sealant is left in your tubeless tire. We were surprised how fast the quantity and the quality of sealants can decrease in your tire.ÃÂÃÂ   Before milKit you had to take the tire off the rim to see how much sealant is left ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> which always ends in a mess. With milKit you can measure and refill the sealant in a tubeless tire without having to release the air from the tire.ÃÂÃÂ   Additionally, milKit valves make the installation of tubeless tires easier (especially in combination with the milKit booster) and prevent the valves from getting clogged by the sealant. Have a look at our video to see more about milKit.ÃÂÃÂ        The way to bringing the milKit system to the market has been a challenge and an amazing time for the milKit team. We are proud of the result and the feedback from you encourages us to keep working in the same direction. New team members have since added valuable inputs to our mission and we are looking forward to solving another problem with a beautiful solution.ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ        Risks and challenges  While we have taken proactive measures to prevent manufacturing and shipment delays, there still might be some things we cannot control. We have gained a lot of experience through our last crowdfunding campaign from which we delivered a high quality product on time ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> so we are fully confident that we will achieve these goals again.  We provide a reinforced Aluminum bottle to guarantee maximum security for our customers. We do not recommend using other bottles than the ones we provide.  Working with pressurized devices always requires the use of safety glasses."

Marsha and I along with our brilliant engineer and IT guy Josh have been running it together ever since. Marsha has been a fast learner and has turned into a great programmer. We have a Friday afternoon show of banter about the arts, music and fun things to do in this area.  It has been great fun for both of us and we enjoy programming the music on the station. We are so happy that we've had such a positive reaction from our listeners as we share our musical tastes with them. Mark has had a life long fascination with radio, especially community radio. We are working to share and enrich our listening area with locally produced community radio from volunteer listeners at some point in the future.

We hope you will join us.",1.0,2011-01-04 15:49:56 -0500,Backed 0 projects,KO,KO,"The Need and the GoalÃÂÃÂ   Since 1994 Waupaca Area Community Radio has been engaged in the pursuit of a construction permit for a nonprofit, Non-Commercial Educational FM Broadcast Facility to provide public access to the people of the Waupaca and Chain OÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> Lakes area. On January 15th, 2014 the group received a Low Power FM construction permit to broadcast on 99.1 FM with the call sign WAUP-LP. On July 8th, 2015 the station signed on the air for the first time and has received an FCC Low Power FM Station License.ÃÂÃÂ   Waupaca Area Community radio seeks to connect community members to one another and the world by exploring cultural diversity through arts and public affairs programming and cultural events. The Waupaca area, with a doubling of population every summer, has been a vacation destination to those seeking refuge in camps and cabins for over one hundred years. Relevant and thoughtful program content will reflect, enhance and preserve this unique geographical identity through open discussion and musical programming, providing a real alternative to traditional radio available in this area.ÃÂÃÂ   Waupaca Area Community RadioÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s objective is to increase the level of community involvement in radio broadcasting by providing a resource that is operated and driven by the community and to engage local nonprofit organizations through mutual mission support.  To continue our mission, it is our urgent need and goal to provide a more robust signal to better serve our listeners by moving our transmission system to the water tower on Mt. Tom in the City of Waupaca. This would be an ideal location to provide a good signal and better coverage of the Waupaca and Chain OÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> Lakes area.  We have IT and Broadcast Engineering expertise in place as well as 2 tower climbers and 4 support personnel available for the move. We are ready to move this project forward.  We will be leasing tower space from the City of Waupaca's water tower on Mt. Tom. Expenses for the lease will be paid by a listener supporter of the station. We also have a challenge donation from another listener supporter. Any donation you make to this campaign will be matched dollar for dollar up to $3000 for a total of $6000!! This will double the impact of your donation so please don't let this opportunity pass by. Help us build a community of voices!!      Risks and challenges  This will be a relatively small challenge as the station is a low power FM broadcast facility. As was stated above, we have great people in place to make this an easy one to two day project. The logistics are straightforward and our crew has plenty of experience moving larger facilities than this one.   We do have one risk factor going into this project.  There is also another low power FM (WILW) on the new tower. We will be co-locating with WILW on this particular tower. There is the slight risk of interference between the two facilities. We have discussed this with WILW and in fact we will be working with them on this project. It has been agreed to by both parties that in the event of interference from WAUP broadcast transmissions, WAUP will cover the expense of purchasing and installing special filters to eliminate the interference.

Board Bring up,10.0,2015-12-15 14:23:29 -0500,Backed 25 projects,"Boston, MA",209,"If you want to use a Raspberry Pi 3 ( or for that matter, a Pi Zero) , a typical initial set up requires a Television, an HDMI Cable and a keyboard.   The Raspberry Pi 3 also has a console boot up more where the console boot messages can appear on its serial port ( UART is a more technical term for it). These UART Pins are available on the 3 pins of the 40 Pin Connector.        We can possible control the Raspberry Pi 3, using the console port. This is where the PiSerialixed comes in picture. It acts as an interface between the Raspberry Pi 3 and the USB Port.        Hooking the Raspberry Pi3 with the PiSerialixed, you can see the console messages and the login through the console to control the Raspberry Pi 3. This avoids the need to use an HDMI TV and Keyboard.  The PiSerialixed can also be used to test the Serial Port or any UART / Serial Port Communication between Raspberry Pi and Laptop. In that case you will be using SSH or the HDTV as the console.   Using PiSerialixed   We have listed the steps to use Pi Serialixed  in our blog here.     Our Earlier Similar Projects on Kickstarter    1. Notixed   Notixed is very similar to the PiSerialized project. It turns Pi Zero into a USB devices - without the need of a cable or connector. Just hook notixed with Pi Zero with the 4 provided screws.ÃÂÃÂ  It was successfully backed by 291 backers and  raised $3,711 on kickstarter .    ÃÂÃÂ  2. Hubpixed    Hubpixed is a 4 Port USB 2.0 Hub that will seamlessly connect to Raspberry Pi Zero without any connector. The novel idea uses the pogo pins. The hubpixed has been updated to support the latest Pi Zero 1.3 and Pi Zero W. It raisedÃÂÃÂ   $3194 from 125 backers on kickstarter .      3. HubPiWi and HubPiWi Blue   The HubPiWi extends the functionality of Hubpixed to include a Wifi on Hubpixed. The HubPiWi Blue extends a WIfi and a Bluetooth. HubPiWi had  149 backers  and HubPiWi Blue had  553 backers .      Risks and challenges  The Prototype has been tested and as such we do not see any Risk.   We have experience with earlier projects with manufacturing and the worst case scenario is slight delay in the delivery ( at the most by 2 weeks). We do not see any other risk with this project."

There are three hundred holes on a STEGO BOARD 100 and there are five hundred on a STEGO BOARD 400. There was no compromise when it came to designing this product. It was changed over forty times during development and went through three generations of physical prototyping. Every hole is there for a reason and has a purpose.  There are even a few holes with hidden uses, which will be revealed in the future.    What are the different STEGO BOARD products?  There are six products for different budgets and build types.ÃÂÃÂ    STEGO BOARD 102  - Small and simple but packed with potential!

We promise.  We can't promise every single order will be on time.  But we have no reason to believe we can't at this point. Be patient with us. We will make weekly updates to keep you informed.       ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  Risks identified. Fabrication is always the main risk and factor for our product. We have a fabricator lined up for this product. TheyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve already run small batches for our prototypes, and have the equipment to do much larger production runs. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve got this covered.  We do not anticipate any significant risks due to the extensive time spent on development of STEGO BOARD. It is our belief that we have planned with great care and covered the many variables associated with providing this great product to our customers."

The glow, the warmth, the smell, it hits on something inside all of us. We love to be around it, yet it always seems to come with this annoying sidekick ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> smoke.ÃÂÃÂ    At BioLite, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve been cleaning up wood fires all over the world for over five years. This time around, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve got our sights set on the fire in your backyard with the BioLite FirePit, a smokeless wood-burning device that cooks your meals and gives you a front-row seat to everything going on inside your fire.        Got 60 seconds? Here's why the BioLite FirePit is different:ÃÂÃÂ          #1:  Get an efficient burn with way less smoke than a conventional fire pit   #2:  Enjoy the feeling of a 360-degree floating fire with the FirePit's X-Ray Mesh   #3 :ÃÂÃÂ Burn charcoal or wood embers for a hibachi-style grilling experience   Bonus: ÃÂÃÂ Our Kickstarter backers receive a free Solar Carry Cover ($60 value). Carry to your favorite outdoor spot and seamlessly charge when not in use.       We know that playing with fire is a touchy subject: why would you want to go and mess with something as classic and lovable as a campfire? Well, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re not messing with it; weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re making it burn the same stuff, just better. This isnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t a weird chemical fuel or a gas flame ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s wood, being the best it can be. All it needs is some air in the right places.ÃÂÃÂ      Typical fire pit vs BioLite FirePit    When you see smoke coming off of a typical campfire or firepit, thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s unburnt fuel; particulate matter that could have been combusted inside of the fire, but instead itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s getting on your clothes, in your hair, and more importantly, in your lungs (thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why so many of us get a headache about an hour or two after sitting around a campfire). Think about it this way: if you saw a car driving down the street with a bunch of smoke coming out of its tailpipe youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>d think thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a badly tuned car. Well guess what, smoky fires are badly tuned fires.ÃÂÃÂ    The BioLite FirePit is a major tune-up. HereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s how we do it:        ÃÂÃÂ        Across the body of the FirePit weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve got 51 airjets that inject the fire with oxygen along key locations thanks to the fan located inside the USB-rechargeable orange power pack. This creates a more uniform temperature and mixing of gases inside the fire which dramatically improves combustion.  This means two important things: 1) You get the crackling, the smell, and the feel of a robust wood fire but WITHOUT the smoke and 2) You can actually achieve a warm, roaring fire with LESS wood because youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re burning your original fuel more efficiently.  The airflow system has 4 fan speeds to control the intensity of your flames. If you want a mellow campfire feel, you tune it to LOW. If you want a powerful fire that radiates a lot of heat outward, crank it up to HIGH.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ    WATCH - FIREPIT UNCUT: Spark-To-Smokeless in under 30 seconds       You can control that fan intensity right from the FirePit's powerpack or from the palm of your hand with the free BioLite Energy App for Android and iOS.       ÃÂÃÂ        Want to see our combustion in action? Tune in on  Wednesday, September 27 @ 1 EST/10 PST ÃÂÃÂ to meet our lead engineers Ryan and Tim as they start a fire from scratch and discuss all things combustion science.       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ   One of the best things about an outdoor fire is watching the hypnotic, relaxing flames.       With BioLiteÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s X-Ray Mesh Body you see it all: glowing embers at the bottom, the gasifying wood in the middle, and the vortex of flames coming out at the top. Rather than staring at a metal can or a cylinder of bricks, you get a full fire that shows you every step of the combustion process.       ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Cooking and campfires both require thermal energy so we combined them into a single device with the FirePit: the inner fuel rack can accommodate both charcoal and wood so you can start your day on a hibachi-style grill and end it with the perfect bonfire. ÃÂÃÂ    Hot Tip : when you start with charcoal, the leftover embers double as the perfect Firestarter for your campfire ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> just toss in a piece of firewood when youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re done cooking and watch it catch, no additional firestarting needed.       ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ        Your FirePit becomes a fully self-reliant ecosystem of energy with our FREE Solar Carry Case, a waterproof cover that uses the power of the sun to recharge the FirePit when not in use so your airflow system is always ready for your next burn. (A $60 value, FREE to all Kickstarter Backers)       ÃÂÃÂ      Effortlessly charge from the sun with the integrated solar panel and micro USB connector    The FirePit's folding legs make transporting a snap. And combined with the Solar Cover's durable carry straps, you're ready to go from the backyard to the beach in no time.       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        Along with our FirePit, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve got some favorites from the BioLite family and some special collaborations for one-of-a-kind items youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>d love to have around the fire.       ÃÂÃÂ        We donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t take fire lightly. It's the reason that the FirePit has been development for over two years.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ    WATCH: Burn testing the FirePitÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Fire is also the reason our organization began and itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s at the core of our mission to bring safe, reliable energy everywhere. Half the planet still cooks over smoky open indoor fires everyday, leading to over 4 million deaths annually. BioLite addresses this head on with the BioLite HomeStove, a wood-burning cookstove that uses similar technology found inside the FirePit to create a safer cooking fire for households across India and sub-Saharan Africa.      ÃÂÃÂ        By backing this project, you help us continue this important work (and the challenges that come with it). To date, over 25,000 homes are cooking with cleaner fires using our technology and with your support, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll grow that exponentially that in the years ahead.        ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        In addition to our lead team above, we'd like to extend a deep thank you to everyone at BioLite who helped us to develop FirePit over the past two years. From prototype testing on remote islands to sourcing our new partners to designing the emails in your inbox, every team member has played a part in bringing this campaign to life. Sales, Operations, Customer Service, we're lookin' at you.        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  This is our third Kickstarter and we have learned a lot from our previous projects and the challenges that came with it. With that in mind, this project has the longest runway for fulfillment weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever scheduled so that we can create realistic expectations around nailing our timelines. Nobody likes delays, and weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re doing everything we can to deliver on an achievable and responsible schedule. That said, with a new production partner, we may still have some learning curves ahead of us but our team will be here to communicate along the way.     Another risk we are taking on is offering our campaign to anyone in the world ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> why is that a risk? Because shipping logistics can get really, really complicated, and very very expensive, especially with a larger and heavier item like the FirePit. We want anyone who wants to have the opportunity to be a backer, and we are doing everything we can to be very upfront about what it takes to get you your FirePit. All international fees include Delivered Duties Paid (meaning you will NOT receive any extra charges upon arrival).  We can assure you that we are not making any money on our international shipping fees, only covering a portion of the full charges."

Using Tesla's designs the voltage is stepped up and connected to the primary coil. The primary coil is coupled with the secondary coil which then outputs a high voltage with a low current arc.   For the future    The Tesla coil will have a internal power source which can be recharged for 30 - 60 minutes of operation with out have to be plugged in.  Instead of having the USB cable hard wired, we want to use a micro USB connector, micro USB cable will be provide with the final product.   We want to improve the high voltage insulation which will require unique shaped polymers which could be 3D printed.  To lower the costs we would need to buy the components in bulk which will be possible with your support.   Current sizes   There are two output modes, low power and and full power.

I did learn some things in school that have helped me along the way including the understanding of what it takes to complete something important. Since receiving my degree I have moved forward in my career and now I manage and mentor engineers and try my best to teach them from my own experiences.

The development of this project came from my 1 year old playing with cables on a Fire TV box sitting on a cabinet in the open. Of course we did not want her to play with this for obvious safety reasons so I needed to figure out somewhere to put the device out of the little ones reach.ÃÂÃÂ        After multiple design concepts using cardboard, tape, and various bits of sheet metal the design was finally realized.Several prototype parts were hand made for testing of the concept and tweaking some dimensions. Next a pilot production run of 300 parts was made using less than optimal production processes.ÃÂÃÂ        The cost of these processes for real production intent to make this product is not realistic though so.....ÃÂÃÂ        In order to manufacture this product at a reasonable cost a  stamping tool  will be needed to get the costs down to a point where this could be a reality. The tooling has been quoted and is ready to begin at the successful completion of this campaign. Considering the $20 or more donation and a reward of 2 of these mounting systems for that donation I think everyone wins.ÃÂÃÂ        TOPshelf is planned to retail at about $30 plus shipping for a 2 pack so this is your opportunity to get in on the early-bird deal... and it really is a good deal for 2!

ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  The risks or challenges with this project are mainly getting the tooling funds needed to make this product cost effective and sustainable. The product has a real need and the design is sound. The patent has been submitted and the trademark has been applied for so that is all set.   The prototypes have been tested. The design has been fine tuned. The pilot production run has been completed. Next is successfully completing this Kickstarter project so I can move forward with this.    Once the stamping tool is a reality there will be about four weeks lead time for completion and after that parts can be made in real quantity to support whatever sales are realized.   This means realistically that from completion of this campaign and then the tooling kickoff date the rewards should be going out before Christmas! Just an idea for your list or for someone you think could use this product!"

Etwa die HÃÂÃÂ¤lfte davon ist danach halbseitig gelÃÂÃÂ¤hmt.ÃÂÃÂ   FÃÂÃÂ¼r diese Menschen haben wir von ReMoD ein tragbares kÃÂÃÂ¼nstliches Gleichgewichtsorgan entwickelt, das die Regelprozesse bei der Bewegungssteuerung mittels Biofeedback nachahmt.

Half of them will be left paralyzed.ÃÂÃÂ     For these people, we have developed ReMoD: a portable, artificial balance organ. ReMoD uses biofeedback to mimic the motion control process of walking. Through this we seek to help people with a half-sided paralysis to relearn a normal gait.ÃÂÃÂ     This procedure is supported by special walking training, based on the principles of biomechanic. Using the training units described in our book ""Applied Biomechanics: Gait training for Patients with hemiparesis"" and  supported by our artificial balance organ, ReMoD, the patient can manage to relearn to walk. The book focuses on patients with hemiparesis, as wes as their relatives and therapists.ÃÂÃÂ     With this Crowdfunding campaign we plan to: 1. Print the first edition of our training book. 2. Use any resources exceeding our funding goal for the production of the testing devices and to finance the medical approval of our biofeedback device.   Unsere GeschichteÃÂÃÂ   Wir, Anna Vonnemann und Dindia Gutmann, sind nicht nur Mutter und Tochter, sondern auch ein Team mit einer Mission. Zusammen haben wir eine innovative Rehabilitationsmethode fÃÂÃÂ¼r halbseitig gelÃÂÃÂ¤hmte Menschen auf der Basis eines kÃÂÃÂ¼nstlichen Gleichgewichtsorgans entwickelt. Diese Entwicklung kann fÃÂÃÂ¼r viele Menschen mit einer halbseitigen LÃÂÃÂ¤hmung mehr LebensqualitÃÂÃÂ¤t und SelbststÃÂÃÂ¤ndigkeit bedeuten.ÃÂÃÂ   Dabei begann alles mit einem Schock: Noch vor der Geburt hatte Dindia einen Schlaganfall. Seitdem leidet sie unter einer halbseitigen LÃÂÃÂ¤hmung, einer sogenannten Hemiparese. Diese fÃÂÃÂ¼hrte zu VerschleiÃÂ<U+009F>erscheinungen in den Gelenken, groÃÂ<U+009F>en Schmerzen und einer Spastik. Trotz mehrerer Therapien konnten die ÃÂ<U+0084>rzte nicht verhindern, dass Dindia das Laufen immer schwerer fiel. Mit elf Jahren war sie immer ÃÂÃÂ¶fter im Krankenhaus, wurde depressiv. Die spastischen KrÃÂÃÂ¤mpfe verschlimmerten sich, ein Leben im Rollstuhl schien unausweichlich.ÃÂÃÂ    Our StoryÃÂÃÂ     We, Anna Vonnemann and Dindia Gutmann, are not only mother and daughter, but also an entrepreneurial team with a mission. Together, we have developed an innovative product and a novel therapy that can increase the quality of life and offer independence for countless others.ÃÂÃÂ     ÃÂÃÂ It all started with a shock. Just three months before birth, Dindia had a stroke. Since then, she has suffered from hemiparesis. This has led to joint problems, severe pain and spasticity. Despite several therapies, doctors could not help. At age eleven, she was spending most of her time in hospital or alone on the sofa and she gradually became depressed. The spastic convulsions were getting worse; life in a wheelchair seemed inevitable.ÃÂÃÂ         ÃÂÃÂ   Ein GerÃÂÃÂ¤t bringt die Welt ins Lot  Obwohl die ÃÂ<U+0084>rzte wenig Hoffnung hatten, wollte ich, Anna Vonnemann, meine Tochter nicht dem Schicksal und dem Rollstuhl ÃÂÃÂ¼berlassen. Ich stellte mich der Herausforderung. ZunÃÂÃÂ¤chst entwickelte ich eigene KÃÂÃÂ¶rperÃÂÃÂ¼bungen fÃÂÃÂ¼r Dindia, trainierte mit ihr jeden Tag das Laufen. Anfangs korrigierte ich die Haltung meiner Tochter durch Zurufe. Daraus entstand 2005 die Idee eines technischen Hilfsmittels, das diese Aufgabe durch elektronische Impulse ÃÂÃÂ¼bernimmt. Ohne technische Vorkenntnisse lÃÂÃÂ¶tete ich Schritt fÃÂÃÂ¼r Schritt eine elektronische Gehhilfe fÃÂÃÂ¼r meine Tochter zusammen. Dindia erlernte mit dem GerÃÂÃÂ¤t und dem von mir, ihrer Mutter, entwickelten Gehtraining wieder das Gehen: Beim ersten Ausprobieren rief Dindia begeistert: ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009E>Mama, die Welt wackelt ja gar nicht mehr!ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>ÃÂÃÂ    A device brings the world into balanceÃÂÃÂ     Although doctors believed that there was little hope medically, we - as mother and daughter - did not want to leave DindiaÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s quality of life to fate and wheelchair; instead we rose to the challenge. I developed exercises for Dindia and trained walking with her every day. At first, I corrected DindiaÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s posture simply by telling her every time she stood or walked at the wrong angle. Out of this, the idea was born for a device that could replace the voice with electronic impulses. Despite having no prior technical knowledge, I engineered an apparatus that could serve this purpose. Step by step, in collaboration with my daughter, I created the motion-sensitive machine. The first prototype was built in 2005 and was kept safe in a pink lunch box. With this device Dindia gradually learned how to walk normally again. When testing the first device, she exclaimed excitedly: ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Mom, the world is not shaking anymore.ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>ÃÂÃÂ         Von der Brotbox zum serienreifen PrototypenÃÂÃÂ   Dieses neu gewonnene LebensgefÃÂÃÂ¼hl mÃÂÃÂ¶chten wir, Dindia Gutmann und Anna Vonnemann, auch anderen Patienten ermÃÂÃÂ¶glichen. Auf der ""Langen Nacht der Wissenschaft"" entstand die Idee, sich wissenschaftlichen Rat zu holen: Mit der UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzung von Dr. RoÃÂ<U+009F>deutscher entwickelten wir Dindias GerÃÂÃÂ¤t stetig weiter. Dr. Wolfram RoÃÂ<U+009F>deutscher ist Forscher am Institut fÃÂÃÂ¼r Konstruktion, Mikro- und Medizintechnik der Technischen UniversitÃÂÃÂ¤t Berlin und Spezialist fÃÂÃÂ¼r HilfsgerÃÂÃÂ¤te fÃÂÃÂ¼r Menschen mit Behinderungen. Zwischen 2008 und 2013 entstand aus dieser Zusammenarbeit ein elektronisches Hilfsmittel namens  Remember-MotionDevice (ReMoD) . Es versorgt den halbseitig gelÃÂÃÂ¤hmten Menschen mit den fÃÂÃÂ¼r die Propriozeption notwendigen Informationen, also Informationen zur Bewegung des KÃÂÃÂ¶rpers und dessen Lage im Raum sowie der Stellung von KÃÂÃÂ¶rperteilen zueinander, ohne die gerades Gehen nicht mÃÂÃÂ¶glich ist.ÃÂÃÂ    From a lunch box to a marketable prototypeÃÂÃÂ     We, Dindia Gutmann and Anna Vonnemann, want to also enable other people to experience this new vitality. We were continuously developing the device with the professional help of Dr. Wolfram RoÃÂ<U+009F>deutscher. Dr. RoÃÂ<U+009F>deutscher is Senior Chief Engineer in the field of medical engineering at the Technical University of Berlin and is a specialist in devices that assist people with disabilities. From 2008 to 2013 the  Remember Motion Device (ReMoD) , an electronic support for the nervous system, was created. It provides the information necessary for proprioception, an individualÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s perception and awareness of their bodyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s position and movement. Paralyzed patients typically exhibit a lack of this indispensable information, a prerequisite needed for a healthy and effective walk.      Die ersten Prototypen / The first prototypes    Das neue GerÃÂÃÂ¤t ist deutlich kleiner als der erste Prototyp und heute ein unauffÃÂÃÂ¤lliger Begleiter im Leben von meiner Tochter Dindia, ÃÂÃÂ die heute Wirtschaftswissenschaften an der Freien UniversitÃÂÃÂ¤t in Amsterdam studiert. Sie geht mit ihrem kleinen Helfer in die Uni, auf Partys und auf Reisen durch Europa, Zentralasien und Nordafrika. ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009E>Kaum jemand hat mich darauf angesprochenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>, erzÃÂÃÂ¤hlt sie. ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009E>Mein Selbstbewusstsein stieg von null auf hundert.ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> WÃÂÃÂ¤hrend Dindia frÃÂÃÂ¼her maximal 200 Meter gehen konnte, wandert sie heute leidenschaftlich gern und legt problemlos Wegstrecken von 14 Kilometern zurÃÂÃÂ¼ck.ÃÂÃÂ    The latest prototype is now much smaller and handier than the first one, forming an inconspicuous companion in the life of Dindia. She uses it at parties as well as on trips around Europe, Central Asia and North Africa. ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Hardly anyone has approached me about itÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ says the young woman. ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>My self-confidence grew from zero to one hundredÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ. She used to be able to walk a maximum of 200 meters, today she is a passionate backpacker and can easily manage walking distances of 14 kilometres.       Dindia mit dem aktuellen Prototypen / Dindia wearing the current prototype    Wie GerÃÂÃÂ¤te von ReMoD funktionieren  Das elektronische GerÃÂÃÂ¤tÃÂÃÂ zur Haltungs- und Bewegungskontrolle, ReMoD,ÃÂÃÂ basiert auf einem Biofeedbackverfahren. Sensoren messen die KÃÂÃÂ¶rperbewegungen; falsche Bewegungen werden dem Nutzer in Echtzeit ÃÂÃÂ¼ber einen elektronischen Impuls rÃÂÃÂ¼ckgemeldet. Der Nutzer wird dadurch animiert, seine KÃÂÃÂ¶rperhaltung umgehend zu korrigieren.ÃÂÃÂ    How ReMoD works    The electronic device for the movement control of ReMoD is based on biofeedback. Sensors measure body movements; incorrect movements are reported back to the user in real time, via electrostimulation. The user is thus animated in order to correct his or her posture directly.

ÃÂÃÂ   Unser ProduktÃÂÃÂ      Biofeedback-GerÃÂÃÂ¤t ReMoD (in Development)    Unser Biofeedback-GerÃÂÃÂ¤t  ReMoD*ÃÂÃÂ  ist ein patentgeschÃÂÃÂ¼tztes IoT-unterstÃÂÃÂ¼tztes elektronisches GerÃÂÃÂ¤t zur Haltungs- und Bewegungskontrolle von Patienten mit Haltungsproblemen. ReMoD versorgt den Patienten mit Informationen zu Bewegungen des KÃÂÃÂ¶rpers und dessen Lage im Raum sowie der Stellung von KÃÂÃÂ¶rperteilen zueinander. Das sind Informationen, die dem Patienten lÃÂÃÂ¤hmungsbedingt fehlen, die jedoch unabdingbare Voraussetzung fÃÂÃÂ¼r das Gehen sind. ReMoD ist in der Lage, zusammengesetzte KÃÂÃÂ¶rperbewegungen wie eine Drehung bei gleichzeitiger Neigung (z.B. der WirbelsÃÂÃÂ¤ule) zu erkennen und das genaue AusmaÃÂ<U+009F> eines Haltungs-/Bewegungsfehlers zu bewerten. Tritt eine falsche Drehung und/oder Neigung des KÃÂÃÂ¶rpers auf, sendet das GerÃÂÃÂ¤t in Echtzeit ein oder mehrere elektrische Signale, die den Benutzer im Idealfall dazu veranlassen, seine Haltung reflexartig zu korrigieren. Der Therapeut kann das Training ÃÂÃÂ¼ber eine kabellose Verbindung in Echtzeit oder auch nachtrÃÂÃÂ¤glich ÃÂÃÂ¼berwachen und auf dieser Grundlage weitere BehandlungsmaÃÂ<U+009F>nahmen planen.ÃÂÃÂ Weitere Informationen finden Sie auf unserer Webseite  www.hemiparese-therapie.de ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ  * In EntwicklungÃÂÃÂ    Our productÃÂÃÂ     Our biofeedback device ReMoD* is a patent-protected, IoT-supported, electronic device for posture and movement control of patients with postural problems. As with ReMoD aids a patient's proprioception by providing crucial information concerning their perception and the relative reality of their body's movement and position in a given space. Sufferers of paralysis often lack this essential information. ReMoD is able to detect multi-dimensional body movements such as a rotation and simultaneous inclination (e.g. of the spine) and to assess the exact extent of any errors in a posture or motion. If the body rotates or tilts incorrectly, the device sends one or more electrical signals in real-time, which will then help to correct the patientÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s posture in a reflex-like manner. The therapist will be able to monitor the training, via a wireless connection, either in real-time or retrospectively, thereby enabling them to plan further treatment on the basis of these results. Through this ongoing Crowdfunding campaign, the publication of our 200-pages long book will be ensured.

Im reich bebilderten dritten Teil werden zahlreiche ÃÂ<U+009C>bungen beschrieben, die fÃÂÃÂ¼r das Gehtraining entwickelt wurden.ÃÂÃÂ   Das Buch ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Angewandte Biomechanik: Gehtraining fÃÂÃÂ¼r HemiparesepatientenÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ wird ab Ende des Jahres auch im deutschen Buchhandel erhÃÂÃÂ¤ltlich sein.   Book ""Applied Biomechanics: Gait Training for patients with hemiparesis"" ÃÂÃÂ     In our book ""Applied Biomechanics: Gait Training for patients with hemiparesis"" by Saskia Holodynski and me, Anna Vonnemann, we present the rehabilitation approach of ReMoD. The first part of the book provides an overview of the current state of research on the topics of hemiparesis, biomechanics, the human course, mechanisms of movement learning and current therapy methods in hemiparesis. The second part of the book deals with the training method developed by ReMoD. It first describes the theoretical fundamentals and further discusses the two components of ReMoD: the biofeedback device for motion control and our walking training based on biomechanical mechanisms. In the third part, numerous exercises that we have personally developed and tested, are presented step   by step through about 100 pages, in order to guarantee a thorough understanding of the exercises.The book ""Applied Biomechanics: Gait Training for patients with hemiparesis"" will be available in German bookshop from the end of the year.ÃÂÃÂ    The book is in German language. It will be translated in 2018.  Please let us know if we should contact you as soon as it is available in English.    ReMoD  2015 grÃÂÃÂ¼ndeten wir, Mutter und Tochter, das Start-Up ReMoD. Unsere junge Firma hat es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht, GerÃÂÃÂ¤te zur Haltungs- und Bewegungskontrolle zu entwickeln und spÃÂÃÂ¤ter auch zu vertreiben.ÃÂÃÂ   In 2015 we, mother and daughter, founded ReMoD. Our young company has set itself the goal of developing and distributing devices to aid and enhance posture and movement.    ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ           Ziel der Crowdfunding Kampagne Ziel dieser Crowdfunding-Kampagne ist es, die erste Auflage des Trainingsbuches ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009E>Angewandte Biomechanik: Gehtraining fÃÂÃÂ¼r HemiparesepatientenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> zu finanzieren. Dieses Training begleitet nicht nur die Arbeit mit unserem Biofeedback-GerÃÂÃÂ¤t, sondern beschreibt auch die Grundlagen eines aufrechten Ganges. Bei Erreichung unserer Fundingschwelle planen wir, das Buch bis November 2017 zu publizieren.     Alle weiteren Einnahmen aus dieser Crowdfunding-Kampagne, die ÃÂÃÂ¼ber die Fertigstellung des Buches hinausgehen, werden der Produktion der TestgerÃÂÃÂ¤te (ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬ 10.000) und darÃÂÃÂ¼ber hinaus der medizintechnischen Zulassung unseres Biofeedback-GerÃÂÃÂ¤ts gewidmet.  Auch derÃÂÃÂ ErlÃÂÃÂ¶s durch den Verkauf des Buches wird in die Finanzierung dieser Vorhaben flieÃÂ<U+009F>en.   Goal of the Crowdfunding CampaignÃÂÃÂ     The goal of this Crowdfunding campaign is to finance the first edition of the training book  ""Applied Biomechanics: Gait Training for patients with hemiparesis"". If we reach the funding threshold of 2,000 euros, we can finally publish our training programme for hemiparesis patients. This training programme not only accompanies the work with our biofeedback device for movement control, but also forms the basis of an upright gait.    However, there are still far greater financial incentives awaiting us, if we reach more than the targeted 2,000 euros. If revenues from this Crowdfunding campaign peak at 5,000 euros, we could have the book translated into English or French. When reaching 10,000 euros, we can produce testing devices. For the admission as a medical product we need a further 50,000 euro. Next would be the costs for the first small batch.     The revenues from the sales of our book will be flowing into financing these projects.   GrÃÂÃÂ¼nde, zu unterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzen  1. Man kann nie wissen - jemand aus Ihrer Familie oder Ihrem Freundeskreis kÃÂÃÂ¶nnte jederzeit betroffen und damit auf fremde Hilfe angewiesen sein.  2. Das Trainingsverfahren von ReMoD verhalf Dindia zu einem normalen Leben ohne Schmerzen. Es ist jetzt wichtig, dass Dindia nicht die Einzige bleibt, die mit der ReMoD-Methode gehen gelernt hat.  3.

You've definitely heard of AI and Deep Learning. But when you ask yourself, what is my position with respect to this new industrial revolution, that might lead you to another fundamental question: am I a consumer or a creator? For most people nowadays, the answer would be, a consumer.  But what if you could also become a creator?  What if there was a way for you to easily break into the World of Artificial Intelligence and build amazing applications which leverage the latest technology to make the World a better place?  Sounds too good to be true, doesn't it?  But there actually is a way..  Computer Vision is by far the easiest way of becoming a creator.  And it's not only the easiest way, it's also the branch of AI where there is the most to create.  Why? You'll ask.  That's because Computer Vision is applied everywhere. From health to retail to entertainment - the list goes on. Computer Vision is already a $18 Billion market and is growing exponentially.  Just think of tumor detection in patient MRI brain scans. How many more lives are saved every day simply because a computer can analyze 10,000x more images than a human?  And what if you find an industry where Computer Vision is not yet applied? Then all the better! That means there's a business opportunity which you can take advantage of.            So now that raises the question: how do you break into the World of Computer Vision?  Up until now, computer vision has for the most part been a maze. A growing maze.  As the number of codes, libraries and tools in CV grows, it becomes harder and harder to not get lost.  On top of that, not only do you need to know how to use it - you also need to know how it works to maximise the advantage of using Computer Vision.  To this problem we want to bring...ÃÂÃÂ        First, Computer Vision A-ZÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ includes a course, which will explain how Computer Vision works, through intuition lectures and practical applications. With this you will get a clear understanding of all the concepts, and the right intuition to approach Computer Vision.  Great, that solves one problem. But the maze is still here.  As the number of codes, libraries and tools grows it becomes harder and harder not to get lost.  How can we get out of this maze? We need more than a courseÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦  Computer Vision A-ZÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ is not only a course. It is also:ÃÂÃÂ        And thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s how Computer Vision A-ZÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ will be so much more powerful than everything you have seen previously!  This Virtual Platform will be your wizard box. It will contain all the most useful Computer Vision tools, in the form of programs and pre-coded templates so that you can adapt them to your own problems.ÃÂÃÂ   All these tools will be well structured in different categories, transforming the previous maze into a crystal clear environment.ÃÂÃÂ   And last but not least, all the packages will be pre-installed and all the models will be pre-trained. Therefore, at no time will you ever have installation issues.       Both the course and the platform follow a common structure:   Module 1: Object Detection  -ÃÂÃÂ This first category will include all the most useful and powerful tools for Object Detection. Here we will be mastering OpenCV, an incredible Computer Vision library. Hence in the end you will become experts in OpenCV. You will learn how to detect any object, either on pictures or videos.     Object Detection     Module 2: Face Recognition -  Here we will create efficient tools for Face Recognition. These tools will be based on OpenCV and even more advanced models such as Deep Neural Networks. They will allow you to detect different features in the face like eyebrows, noses and even smiles. A modern application of this technique is to recognize expressions of customers in marketing and cinema.     Face Recognition     Module 3: Style Transfer -ÃÂÃÂ  A must-do in Computer Vision! In this category we will implement the very popular GANs, Generative Adversarial Networks. We will apply them for Style Transfer, a technique that takes as input two pictures or images, and transfers the style of one into the other.     Style Transfer     Image Source:ÃÂÃÂ https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf   Keep in mind that all the codes/tools of this virtual platform will be explained in details, both on the theory side as on the practical side.

If you pass this course you deserve the right to show your new skills by default - thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why our certificate of completion comes free for you to show to future employers, further your business credentials or simply to show off to friends.   ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve already done the Deep Learning and/or AI course, will this course still benefit me?ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ   Deep Learning and AI are great tools in your toolkit. However, Computer Vision is a very practical technology. The beauty of Computer Vision is that you can apply it to any images, videos and even streaming data - so it's very easy to spot applications in real life.

Computer Vision is a huge part of all our lives so itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s only fair that you have an equal opportunity to get involved and create. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re passionate about bringing AI and Computer Vision to the world, and today we need your help to ensure this groundbreaking package becomes a reality.   Thank you,  Kirill and Hadelin           Risks and challenges  There are numerous risks associated with creating an online course. Some of the major ones include: sourcing the right equipment, learning to produce clear and engaging tutorials, finding what exactly interests our students, having the appropriate level of subject matter expertise and timely delivery of the materials.  Having built up a substantial level of expertise in the space of online education we are confident that we are well-equipped to face any challenges: we have tried and tested equipment including backup hardware and software; between the two of us we have already produced over 20 courses with hundreds of hours of content and almost a thousand tutorials enabling us to develop our unique engaging teaching styles; we constantly interact with our existing 200,000+ students including Q&amp;A, webinars and surveys - this allows us to know exactly what common painpoints we need to address in the course content; and finally, we do have extensive backgrounds in Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning / AI but we are constantly doing research and deepening our own knowledge to make sure we can deliver the best of the best to our students in Computer Vision A-ZÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢.   Regardless of our expertise, hard work and the love we put into our campaigns, delays may happen. For instance, we are currently experiencing some delay in the delivery of the last material from our previous Kickstarter Campaign: Artificial Intelligence A-ZÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢. Even though we will deliver our promises as soon as possible and plan to avoid this as much as we can from happening again, we wanted to make everybody aware that delays in content delivery could happen again in the future."

See for yourself what DrinkPure HOME can do for your tap water!       ÃÂÃÂ        During the first week of our crowdfunding, many people asked us if DrinkPure HOME can also reduce lime scale. Thanks to the achievement of our first goal, we now stretched the goal and offer you also the a DrinkPure HOME water softener cartridge, an add-on in combination with our DrinkPure HOME filter cartridge! Now itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s up to you! You can choose if you would like to reduce lime scale or not! Spread the news that DrinkPure HOME now can also reduce limescale! If you have already supported us, just add another 20 CHF to your pledge and you will receive a softener cartridge, too!       ÃÂÃÂ       It fits on your existing faucet and can be installed within seconds ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> yes, it is that simple. One filter cartridge lasts up to 130 gallons (500 L) or two months and can easily be replaced.   The water that flows through our filter will always be safe from bacteria and viruses, even after more than 130 gallons. The flow rate will just decrease and the emerging chlorine smell will tell you that itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s time to replace the filter cartridge.        ÃÂÃÂ If you would like to get a reminder, just scan the QR code on each replacement cartridge! This sends you a calendar entry reminding you of a possible exchange after two months. It also tells you where to order new cartridges. You do not need to install an app!       More than 100 million plastic bottles are used worldwide every day. Only 1 out of 5 plastic bottles is recycled.   Using DrinkPure HOME reduces plastic waste by more than 99%. The replaceable cartridge weighs as much as one empty 1 liter plastic bottle and replaces up to 500 x 1 liter or 1000 x 0.5 liter bottles.   This is our cartridge size compared to other available cartridges on the market:       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ       Most of the bottled water you buy is just glorified tap water. Only a few brands use water directly from springs and mountain streams. 90% of the cost of bottled water is based on marketing and packaging, not the water quality. On top of that, it takes 3 liters of tap water to produce 1 liter of bottled water!   ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s about time that we take back the tap and put an end to this global insanity. One filter can help you save 90% of your current water cost or more than USD 1,000 per year.

Thanks to its very small pores and its special three-dimensional structure, the membrane is able to reduce e-coli bacteria by more than 99.9999% and even the smallest type of viruses can be removed by 99%. Furthermore, our own membrane has a flow rate, which is ten times higher than similar products on the market. This allows us to use additional layers, which results in higher purification levels while at the same time making the filter as small as it is now.       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ      DrinkPure HOME compared to other common faucet filters    ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        It has been a long road since we first had the idea to turn tap water into actual drinking water. We believe that clean drinking water is the most important element of health and well-being. It was a huge challenge to concentrate all our ideas in one small device, but we never gave up to make our dream come true. Thanks to our technology and know-how, we are finally able to turn every faucet into a source of healthy and natural tasting water. Moreover, we have created a powerful device to minimize the waste originating from water bottles. After two years of development and more than 50 prototypes, we are just one step away. With your support on Kickstarter we can produce the final injection-mold parts and bring DrinkPure HOME to households all over the world.

ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  Creating a new product is always associated with risks. There are unpredictable factors which may emerge. However, we have developed over 50 prototypes. These were tested by many people in different countries. We strongly believe that we will be in a position to deliver DrinkPure HOME according to plan. We have prepared the process very carefully and it is already well advanced. But even then, surprises can arise which cannot be avoided. Also, even though we work with established contract manufacturers and parts producers, there is always a chance that something might go wrong. We have carefully selected our partners, with some of them having been partners for years. The patented Novamem DrinkPure(TM) membrane is produced by our own company in Switzerland and is already successfully implemented in an outdoor water filter that has been on the market for more than two years. Having gained experience with product manufacturing, we will do everything we can to deliver DrinkPure HOME in time. We are excited to take on this challenge with you to deliver a revolutionary product!"

It's ÃÂÃÂ comes in two color ways, raw or gunmetal.  Staff picked because:    1) THE BUILD IS BEEFY  - it's constructed with a double-shot injected FULL TPU from body to core. Most speakers use over or single shot molding processes that aren't nearly as strong/thick. This process allows us the insane 4k lbs. crushproof rating.ÃÂÃÂ   Since we use TPU, the speaker also absorbs shocks better than most speakers, which are generally made from abs plastics. ABS plastics are weaker and more brittle than TPU, but are used because...well...they're about half the price to use. TPU has insanely high shear and elastic strange, making it great in impact situations - for us, from 100ft. to the dirt, or from 30ft onto concrete, guaranteed.ÃÂÃÂ    2) THE SOUND IS SUMPTUOUS  - this is the speaker which caused one blind tester to say it had, ""depth and clarity that gave [them] chills."" We cannot summarize it better. Of all its totable competitors, this 86db, 50w speaker takes the cake. It quite simply has a fuller sound, and better bass.

The MacroBoom is our entry level speaker, the ""younger brother"" of the Macro.II, and the ""child"" of the GigaBoom.ÃÂÃÂ    ""I found RoamProof browsing through Kickstarter and backed their unit MacroBoom. After months of waiting my unit arrived and I was thrilled with its performance. Unfortunately an issue arose with the speaker and it stopped working. I contacted RoamProof, provided proof and they promptly arranged a replacement, which has been roaming with me for ages.The quality of the unit is great and so is their service. Good stuff guys, I'm happy to support such a stellar company.""    -C Williams (MacroBoom Backer)    ""This really is an awesome piece of equipment! And it definitely is equipment. Heavy duty as all get out! The mounting attachments you get really open up the possibilities of where you can conveniently take this thing. I listen to it in my truck because it sounds better than my old worn out sound system. I put it on my dirtbike and essentially drag this thing through the mud. Hang it up in the shower. Doesn't skip a beat.""    -R. H. K (MacroBoom Amazon Customer)    ""This is an amazing piece of audio technology, and it's virtually indestructible. I take it everywhere - beach, pool, hiking, biking. I even take it in the shower! I have been wanting a waterproof Bluetooth speaker for years and am so glad that I waited to purchase one because the MacroBoom IP67 has more features and functions than I could have imagined. But the best part of what this unit has to offer is the crystal clear, rich and deep soundscape and the long battery life. I would recommend the MacroBoom to anyone who is wanting a portable, rugged speaker with audiophile sound quality. This is truly a top shelf product!""    - D.

People just canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t find a one-stop solution when facing a flood of adapters. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve tested almost all type C docks and hubs in the market, and disappointingly none of these provides the ultimate satisfaction to serve as an ideal and unique accessory for MacBook Pro.        Introducing DockCase:ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   a breakthrough solution for MacBook Pro that integrates a protective carry-case with a nine-port docking station. We know what a hassle it is to be faced with so many different types of dongles. Choosing between docks and cases can be such a drag. DockCase makes it easy: a one-stop solution with wide-ranging functionality and superior protection, all in a sleek and simple design.        ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Carrying around a handful of dongles is such a pain, and sometimes forget to bring the right adapter to get things done makes it worse. The DockCase packs the MacBook Pro with all missing ports back. YouÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll never get wrong with the DockCase. It is designed to be the ultimate accessory for your MacBook Pro.ÃÂÃÂ   Many dock solutions on the market are loose on the connection part, which makes data transfer more fragile than ever. The DockCase connects to your MacBook Pro stably with the provided type C cable that avoid connection loose and data loss.        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        One adapter is not enough to get things done?ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Tired of plugging in and off to replace adapters?  Sometimes forget to take it, and even canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t find them anymore?  DockCase has a total of nine different ports with five connection types. With DockCase, you can connect your SD card, hard drive, flash drive, monitor, camera, printer, phone, and more, all at the same time. Save the time replacing and finding new adapters, enjoy the one-stop solution that makes a productive MacBook Pro.  ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Precision-milled dock adopts premium aluminum alloy, endures abrasions and heat dissipation.

If youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever been in a situation thinking about what horse is the one youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re supposed to pick up, or even walked away with the wrong horse for lack of immediate access to its microchip data, let us assure you...weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve been there!    The Anitar Bullet is a device for breeders, vets, horse professionals, farmers, and rescuer.   ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ   The founding story of Anitar goes back to a misty afternoon at a field in KjÃÂÃÂ³s, a farm area close to Reykjavik. Karl MÃÂÃÂ¡r, our founder, keeps his horses there. As itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s common at Icelandic farms, horses free-range and mingle with horses of other riders. Sometimes, their tint differs. Other times, they happen to look and behave identically. As KarlÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s horse is usually very shy and afraid of people, Karl ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> without any hesitations ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> picked up the shy, grey horse and not the one that walked up to him. He was pretty embarrassed when he got a call why his horse was still standing out on the field from a lady who couldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t find her favorite companion, and who, as you can imagine, wasnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t amused.  You might be able to recognize your horse immediately, but whatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s with all the other people who have day-to-day access to your horse? Breeders, trainers, farriers, caretakers, or other riders; can you be sure they pick the right horse?       ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Using the Anitar Bullet  Up to this date, there hasnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t been a reliable, easy to use solution suitable for the needs of todayÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s farmers. Most RFID animal tag readers are expensive, clunky, and require the user to run all operations manually. Besides that, the common procedure consists of scanning a horse, then driving somewhere to access a computer with an internet connection to then look up the microchip number in WorldFengur or some other livestock database. The longer you think about it, the more you might wonder why itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s taken so long for someone to innovate this area of livestock farming!

The Anitar Bullet is a RFID solution that bridges between livestock and various databases to help track, register, and identify animals in a snap, all with the help of the device you carry around in your pocket at all times anyway: your phone.ÃÂÃÂ        How to use the device  ThereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s no need to charge the Anitar Bullet. The device is compatible with iOS and Android. The hardware is light, sleek, and fits in any pocket or can be placed worry-free anywhere at the stable for shared use, given its water-repellent nature. The RFID technology allows for codes to be read from a distance of up to ten centimeters, which will then automatically display in your Anitar app, which you can download in the app store to track your Icelandic horses.       Where we're at       After having built several prototypes of the Anitar Bullet, developing the necessary software, testing the device extensively, and securing access to WorldFengurÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s data, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re ready for production. ThereÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s just one catch: we cannot realize this project and hit the minimum order amount at the manufacturer of our choice without your help. We need to find at least 250 committed and forward-thinking farmers, breeders, veterinarians, and horse lovers who believe in our vision and choose to help us make the Anitar Bullet a reality. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve done the hard work, so we hope you share our vision and accompany us through our production process. We want your input, your feedback, and we hope for your support.       We believe itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s time to start the technical revolution at the stable and we would love to have you join us! Please pledge to this project, tell your friends, call the person who taught you horseback riding, and help us make this the most successful Kickstarter project IcelandÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s seen to date! Hobb, hobb!  Technical detail  To create a sleek, water-repellent device, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve used ABS plastics. Given that many times, these sort of devices run out of battery rather quickly or right when you need them to work most, our device is directly connected to your phone (iPhone5 or Android 4.1 or newer). Once you open the Anitar app, youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be able to operate the device without any complicated pre-installment. The Anitar Bullet is also small enough to easily fit into your pocket. With 120g, it weighs as much as an apple. Speaking of apples, itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s so small (15cmx5,5cmx1,6cm) youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>d have space to bring a drink or a snack for yourself.

As we focus on farm technology, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re operating in an industry that hasnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t been as radically innovated in the past as many other branches. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re lucky to have received a lot of support from the Icelandic government who believe in our mission: to make livestock farming easier and more efficient.   WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve proven weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re capable of developing a well-functioning software product, which you can already download in the app store. This experience has proven to us we have a strong team and people we can rely on. But given software can only go so far, we knew we had to hire some additional team members and realize a hardware solution to really make the lives of our customers and users easier.   Our early prototypes have demonstrated that the core technology works well and that we have a great team and partners supporting the vision.

First, we take a 3"" piece of high density hybrid foam (3 lbs/cu.ft), and cut out a 2 ÃÂÃÂ¼ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ x 2 ÃÂÃÂ¼ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ rectangular cylinder.       The cushion is then encased in a fabric pocket. This is our ""Cushion Pocket"", an invention that provides superior comfort and cleanliness compared to any mattress.

Our active airflow channels facilitate a refreshing nightÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s sleep and the individually sealed cushions ensure an unmatched level of cleanliness.       We bring it all together with our uniquely designed cover, itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s miniature cushion pads provide an added level of comfort while the engineered air channels promote airflow to maximize the effects of our technology.ÃÂÃÂ        Our independent suspension isolates every inch of the sleeper's body, exhibiting absolute responsiveness for your preferred sleeping position.

The SleepOvation mattress providesÃÂÃÂ the ultimate level of skeletal support to prevent back pain, discomfort, and restlessness.                 Our cushion layer promotes airflow between its active air channels so you can sleep cool through the night, and awake refreshed because itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s not just about how you sleep but also how you feel when you wake up.

No other mattress is this airflow capable, or can offer you active air channels altogether.            In addition to a zip-off removable and washable cover, our mattress ensures the utmost level of hygiene by providing access to the cushion layer.       You can now vacuum in-between the hundreds of individually sealed cushion pockets to eliminate dust, dirt, bacteria and allergens found in other mattresses known to trigger skin infections, asthma, and allergies.

After conducting summer research on hepatic stellate cells at the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy and the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute at Rutgers University, Jason became extremely concerned by how inaccessible biological instruments were outside of large established research labs. Consequently, Jason started DoubleGene in order to produce and market more affordable biological lab equipment available for everyone. By providing cost-effective instruments through DoubleGene, Jason hopes to proliferate and heighten public interest in biotechnology.",1.0,2017-07-01 19:35:00 -0400,Backed 0 projects,"Princeton, NJ",25,"The microcentrifuge is one of the most fundamental devices used in biological research.  It can separate a variety of important substances including DNA and proteins from liquid samples, making it extremely versatile and crucial to almost every protocol.ÃÂÃÂ   However with modern microcentrifuges costing nearly $300 or more, it has been extremely difficult to integrate the technology within both STEM education biotechnology labs and basic labs within the home. Additionally, currently offered microcentrifuges have adopted intimidating user interfaces, making the centrifugation process a lot more complicated than it needs to be.   We created Polyfuge in order to democratize centrifugation technology for everyone.  Polyfuge is an inexpensive open-source Arduino-based DIY microcentrifuge kit that costs only $96.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ         The Basics of Microcentrifuges   Microcentrifuges are able to separate various substances from solution by density through harnessing a force known as centrifugal force. When an object is spun in circular motion, centrifugal force is exerted outwards away from the center of the circular path. This is why you feel pushed against the outer edge of roller coasters during loops!  Biological centrifuges use this same principle except with liquid mixtures. Through spinning tubes containing liquid samples at very high RPMs, microcentrifuges use centrifugal force to separate the substances within the sample by density.ÃÂÃÂ         Example of Biological Centrifugation   An excellent example of biological centrifugation is the centrifugation of blood. While blood generally appears as a uniform red mixture, the centrifugation of blood separates the substance into three layers: red blood cells, white blood cells &amp; platelets, and plasma.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ         At a price of only $96, Polyfuge is currently the most affordable microcentrifuge on the market, allowing us to bring biotechnology into the world like never before.ÃÂÃÂ    Current microcentrifuge technology has been solely targeted towards formal research labs, making it extremely difficult for STEM students and casual lovers of biology to experiment with biotechnology protocols within science classrooms and labs within the home.ÃÂÃÂ   Polyfuge solves this problem through providing a  user-friendly and accessible  alternative to modern centrifuge options.ÃÂÃÂ    Our Hardware   We designed Polyfuge with a simplistic, lightweight, and sturdy design that occupies very little space on the lab table. It is constructed from interlocking panels reinforced with M3 nuts and bolts, making the overall structure highly robust.ÃÂÃÂ For rotation, we utilized a high-speed 2300kv brushless motor for effective but controlled centrifugation. In order to prevent users from directly making contact with the rotor during centrifugation sessions, we have implemented an optical sensor to detect when the lid is open and subsequently stop the motor, ensuring user safety.     Physical comparison between Polyfuge and a typical laboratory microcentrifuge.     Simplistic User-Interface   To make Polyfuge truly for everyone, we recognized the need for a  straightforward and effective user-interface . That's why we created Polyfuge with a basic rotary encoder-LCD screen UI. Through directly prompting the user for speed and time inputs, we made it so that Polyfuge can be operated by absolutely anyone without difficulty.   Software   In addition to open-source hardware, the software for Polyfuge will be open-source as well. We decided to control our electronics using the  Arduino IDE  in order to keep Polyfuge affordable and easy to use. Polyfuge contains a dedicated USB port for uploading code if the user decides to modify or improve our provided code.     Maxwell Sun (a sophomore in high school) makes tweaks to Polyfuge's internal code through the Arduino IDE.     Make Your Own Biology Equipment!   One of the amazing things about Polyfuge is that it's a microcentrifuge that you can assemble yourself! We are huge proponents of the DIYbio movement, and our Polyfuge kits provide a great way for users to build their own lab equipment. The assembly process is extremely easy and requires no soldering at all. All you need to do is assemble the frame using the provided M3 bolts and nuts, and plug the components into the main circuit board.ÃÂÃÂ   Building DIY lab equipment is great for STEM classroom environments, where students can learn what components are needed to make microcentrifuges work. Assembling Polyfuge is also a great activity for groups and encourages collaborative work.     Wilson Wu (high school sophomore) works on assembling a Polyfuge kit with other students.    ÃÂÃÂ        We strongly believe that the best way to contribute to developments in biotechnology is to  enhance the accessibility of biological equipment for everyone.  With more passionate people working together, we can accelerate the pace of biological research and discovery like never before. There are plenty of brilliant minds out there, and our goal is to provide the instruments needed for those people to make change.     Michelle Qing (high school STEM student) loads tubes into Polyfuge for a Casein Precipitation experiment.    Polyfuge was created in order to help bring research equipment into classrooms and homes. Students interested in pursuing biological research fields may use Polyfuge to gain firsthand experience with basic laboratory protocols. Through the democratization of centrifugation technology, we hope to allow  anyone interested in biotechnology  to access affordable microcentrifuges.     High school seniors Catherine Yang and Harry Feng prepare solutions for centrifugation using Polyfuge.    ÃÂÃÂ        With every Polyfuge kit, we provide both a Casein Precipitation and DNA Extraction protocol so that  you can conduct low-cost experiments right after assembly with reagents you can find in your kitchen!  With our Casein Precipitation experiment, explore how the isoelectric point of casein affects its solubility through centrifuging proteins from milk. In our DNA Extraction protocol, gain a deeper understanding of DNA isolation through extracting your own genomic DNA from a spit sample. Polyfuge opens endless opportunities for scientific thought and experimentation!       With your support, we will also create an  online database of user-submitted biological protocols  tested with Polyfuge, so that users can share their self-designed experiments with the rest of the Polyfuge community, making the applications of Polyfuge truly limitless.ÃÂÃÂ        While Polyfuge possesses great potential in widening the accessibility of biotechnology,  we need your support in order to maximize Polyfuge's influence everywhere.ÃÂÃÂ    Kickstarter provides us with a platform through which we can project the ideas behind Polyfuge to a much larger audience. Through backing our campaign, you are not only contributing to the development and mass production of Polyfuge, but you are also playing a crucial part in expanding the integration of Polyfuge within various schools and communities around the world.       Ultimately, the future of Polyfuge depends on you - we hope that you make pledges and spread the word to help make Polyfuge a reality.ÃÂÃÂ  Support the next generation of affordable laboratory equipment. ÃÂÃÂ         We've brought Polyfuge to several STEM education conferences and received exceptional feedback and interest. During our showcase at  STEMteachersNYC at Columbia University , many STEM teachers expressed great excitement at the prospect of bringing centrifugation technology into classroom environments with Polyfuge. Additionally, the concept of physically building biotechnology equipment provided an interdisciplinary experience, rooted in both biology and engineering, that many STEM educators were eager to include within their curricula.ÃÂÃÂ      Polyfuge being presented at STEMteachersNYC at Columbia University (left) and Montgomery High School STEM Day in Skillman New Jersey (right).    One of the primary audiences we hope to reach with Polyfuge are students, so we decided to bring and demo Polyfuge at  Montgomery High School's STEM Day  event for both students and parents to try. New Jersey high school and middle school students showed immense enthusiasm for the hands-on approach that Polyfuge takes in displaying research protocols, and how Polyfuge would allow them to fully visualize the processes taught within their biology textbooks.  Our adventures to various STEM-related conferences have shown us that teachers and students from many communities are excited about what Polyfuge can do. Now we need your help to further expand the influence of Polyfuge and deliver this affordable biotechnology experience to the rest of the world.ÃÂÃÂ             ÃÂÃÂ        With your support, we plan on designing another rotor for use with 0.2 mL PCR tube strips. Our current Polyfuge prototype already supports interchangeable rotors, so we would like to make use of that feature through experimenting with different rotor designs for varying tube sizes (our current rotor is compatible with standard 1.5 mL and 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes).       Additionally, we plan on making improvements to the current Polyfuge circuit board in order to make the assembly process even more simplistic. Through reducing the number of required pins, the user will have less connections to make and consequently an easier assembly experience.ÃÂÃÂ        We tried our absolute best to reduce shipping costs as much as possible, which is why we established  free shipping for all U.S. domestic orders.  For our international backers, we have set a flat rate of $36 for both our individual and classroom Polyfuge rewards.       Production for our Polyfuge kits will begin as soon as the funding period ends, meaning that you can expect your Polyfuge kit to arrive before the end of 2017. Throughout our production process, you will receive frequent email updates regarding our progress and your shipment status.ÃÂÃÂ        Polyfuge was invented by Jason Wu following his research internship at the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy and the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute at Rutgers University in 2016. Following his work, he became extremely concerned by how inaccessible biological instruments were outside of large established research labs. Jason consequently created Polyfuge in order to provide cost-effective lab equipment available for everyone. Through Polyfuge, he hopes to proliferate and heighten public interest in biotechnology.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ       Risks and challenges  Our current Polyfuge prototypes have not demonstrated any issues whatsoever. The units that we will be shipping out to backers will be nearly identical to the functioning prototypes with very slight modifications to the circuit board. Throughout the post-funding period, we will be providing constant updates to our backers regarding the status of our production and shipment schedule. Consequently, we do not expect any risks whatsoever."

With your help our new SousVide Supreme Touch+ will revolutionize sous vide cooking once again.       WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re the company who brought sous vide cooking to home kitchens around the world. We want to make some amazing upgrades to our SousVide Supreme that will elevate the sous vide cooking experience to a whole new level.       The new SousVide Supreme Touch+ will have a similar look and feel to the iconic original SousVide Supreme, but with some innovative upgrades that will make it not only the most convenient sous vide machine to use, but the most advanced at-home sous vide machine there is. The Touch+ will include ingenious features such as:    Responsive Touch Technology  ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> The new Touch+ has a control screen that you can navigate even with wet fingers. When your hands get wet from cookingÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>as they most surely will doÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>no problem! The new Touch+ will still respond perfectly. You can easily change the temperature, set the timer, or power it on or off.   A Clear View Lid  - SousVide Supreme users have never had to struggle with using ping-pong balls or aluminum foil tents or other extreme measures to keep in the heat. Our patented lid handled that beautifully. But now, that lid is fashioned of a single piece of molded clear plastic to let you see whatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s going on, without lifting the lid and wasting valuable heat. All you have to do is look inside.   Energy Efficiency  - The Touch+ retains the energy efficient, cool-touch double-wall insulation of the original, so the water stays hot, but the machine stays cool to the touch. Once at temperature, the Touch+ uses only about the energy of a 20W light bulb. Safer for kids; better for the environment.  I ntegrated Wifi  - You can control your Touch+ from anywhere with the newly integrated wifi. You can start and set your machine right from your phone and have the water bath at temperature and ready to go by the time you get home!   A new state-of-the-art app  - Connect with people who love cooking as much as you do. You can program your new Touch+ with recipes you find on social media, and then upload pictures of your finished dish to your favorite social platforms to show everyone how it all turned out!

ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s there, sitting pretty on your countertop, right at home next to your espresso machine and with water already in it. All you have to do is tell Alexa to turn it on! You donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t even have to push a button.      Water Resistant Touch Screen    ÃÂÃÂ      See-through Lid    ÃÂÃÂ      Programmable Recipes    ÃÂÃÂ      Alexa Enabled    ÃÂÃÂ        Sous vide? WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re glad you asked. The words literally mean ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>under vacuumÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ in French and they describe a cooking technique, first developed in France ÃÂÃÂ in the 1970ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s by Chef Georges Paulus; it relies on precise temperature control rather than great skill and perfect timing to achieve chef-worthy results. Food is vacuum-sealed and immersed in a precisely heated water bath to cook gently and perfectly. When you cook sous vide, your food develops deep flavors and textures that no other cooking method can duplicate.  While the term sous vide means ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>under vacuumÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ, you might just as well define it as ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>stunningly simpleÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ especially when you use the Sous Vide Supreme Touch+. The sous vide cooking process boils down to three steps:        1. Season  - Season foods with your favorite herbs or spices.  ÃÂÃÂ  2.ÃÂÃÂ Seal  - Vacuum seal food in a food-grade cooking pouch.   3. Sous Vide  - Drop the sealed packages into the SousVide Supreme. No need for office clips, extra pots, Styrofoam coolers or ping-pong balls. The water oven does most of the work. Just set it and walk away!       ÃÂÃÂ        We are the original innovators, who brought sous vide cooking to home kitchens around the world and our patented technology is unique. SousVide Supreme's award-winning technology and product design features a PID-controlled edge-to-edge heating element that blankets the bottom of the water oven. A perforated convection plate generates thermal currents for even temperature distribution. Our patented lid contains heat for energy efficiency, contains steam to prevent evaporation, and even serves as a tray for transporting pouches from the water oven to the stove or grill. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s also a sleek and beautiful and counter-worthy machine.  The natural thermal circulation created by the design works with the basic physical properties of water to evenly heat the water to the target temperature throughout the bath, from top to bottom and corner to corner, without the need for a circulating propeller or pump. The precise temperature control gently brings the food to its ideal doneness and cooks it perfectly from edge to edge. Once brought to temperature, the efficient heat transfer capacity in our enclosed, self-contained system uses only about the energy of a 20 watt light bulb to precisely maintain the target temperature for hours or even days.            And now with integrated wifi and Alexa capabilities powered by our new app, the SousVide Supreme Touch+ will be the most technologically advanced sous vide water oven on the market.ÃÂÃÂ   It's time to ditch your ""science project"" and step up to a state-of-the-art, serious sous vide appliance. Unlike circulator sticks, there is no remembering to put a hot pad down so your pot doesn't burn your counter, connecting a circulator to a pot, using an office clip to fasten a flimsy plastic bag to the side, and then creating a lid out of ping pong balls or foil to keep the heat in. No need to set the alarm to remember to add water lest the pot boil dry.  The revolutionary SousVide Supreme Touch+ is an all-in-one cooking appliance that will make it easier for cooksÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>from beginners to top chefsÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>to consistently prepare gourmet quality food at home and have more time do the other things they really love.       Learn more about the differences between an all-in-one SousVide Supreme and an immersion circulator:      ÃÂÃÂ        Advantages of Sous Vide Cooking  It goes without saying that the sous vide cooking technique will make you the envy of your friends, but the benefits go far deeper than mere peer adulation and they all come down to three things: better nutrition, free time, and more money.

Save money!  Sous vide cooking lets you turn inexpensive, but flavorful, cuts of meat into gourmet delights as tender as filet mignon. YouÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll never ruin a good steak again. You can make your own infused spirits and syrups for retro cocktails instead of buying expensive ones off the shelf. The savings go on and on!        10 Things You Didn't Know You Could Cook with a Sous Vide Supreme  1.  Ricotta Cheese/Yogurt  - The precisely-controlled water temperature makes cheese and yogurt-making effortless. Because the bath is unstirred, you can make them right in the water oven basin without a pouch.  2.  Condiments  - Use your imagination to develop your own condiments! Grainy mustard, Worcestershire sauce, hot dill pickles, pickled summer veggies, and more.ÃÂÃÂ   3.  Cheesecake  - An unstirred sous vide bath is already the perfect  bain marie  for cooking traditional oven recipes requiring a water cushion and constant temperatures, like cheesecake, crÃÂÃÂ¨me brÃÂÃÂ»lÃÂÃÂ©e, or flan! Using a SousVide Supreme eliminates the challenge (and danger) of sloshing hot water onto the floor when filling or removing a pan from a traditional oven.  4.  The perfect egg  - Just set the temperature and put eggs in their shells directly into the water bath to cook and BAMÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>perfect poached eggs! And best of all, theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll hold just as perfectly cooked for hours!  5.  Soup stock  - Use an unstirred water bath to make luscious bone broth or stock right in the water bath basinÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>no pouch requiredÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>to use for homemade soup or just to drink for good health!  6.  Custards and iceÃÂÃÂ cream base  - No need for constant stirring to keep from scorching your custard on a stovetop. With sous vide youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be able to make perfect custard for homemade ice cream, crÃÂÃÂ¨me brÃÂÃÂ»lÃÂÃÂ©e, or flan, just like a pro.  7.  Overnight oatmeal  - Drop a pouch of oatmeal into the water oven at bedtime and it will be ready when you wake up. Say goodbye to that ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0098>no time for breakfast IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m just grabbing coffeeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099> excuse as youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re running out the door for work in the morning!  8.  Epic Bloody Mary  - Use the sous vide technique to create the perfect pickled vegetablesÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>asparagus, okra, or green beans ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> for an epic Bloody Mary! You can even infuse the horseradish right into vodka in a matter of hours in a water oven.  9.  Gourmet vinegar  - Precise cooking temperatures help to quickly transfer flavor from herbs, spices, and berries without holding your kitchen hostage with that vinegar smell!  10.  Infused alcohols and syrups  - Traditionally made limoncello takes weeks or months to make. With sous vide, that timeline drops to hours or in some cases even minutes! The gentle heat speeds up the process of transferring natural flavors to the alcohol, helping you create old school cocktails on short notice for an impromptu dinner party!      ÃÂÃÂ        It all started with a pork chop. We (The Drs. Eades,  pere  and  mere ) had arrived late to a medical meeting in Las Vegas and were extraordinarily tired and hungry. We ordered a double-cut pork chop off the room service menu (in truth, with some slight reservations, because youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>d expect a room service chop to be dried out and overcooked.) But when we took a bite, it was like no pork chop we had ever eaten: juicy and perfectly cooked from edge to edge with a golden crust on the surface. Simply divine! We were so surprised, we asked at the dining room how it was cooked and they told us ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0098>sous videÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>. We vowed to find a machine that would replicate that chop.    We know food and cooking. WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve owned a restaurant, written and hosted a 26-episode PBS television cooking show, authored a NY Times best-selling diet book, as well as being nutritional experts and physicians by trade. But it was through our quest to recreate that perfect pork chop that we discovered our passion for sous vide cooking.ÃÂÃÂ   Our first stab at cooking sous vide at home involved a DIY makeshift contraption that consisted of a large stock pot, balanced over the gas burner atop a simmering ring from an old wok, with a candy thermometer hooked to the side. The two of us kept watching minute-by-minute, adding ice cubes or hot water as needed throughout the hour-long cooking process to keep the temperature steady. Suffice it to say it wasnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t the most convenient method, but it worked and the steak we cooked was delicious!ÃÂÃÂ   We were convinced we had to have more of this sous vide cooked food, but neither of us willing to stand over the pot with ice cubes for an hour, so we scoured the internet trying to find a home sous vide machine. To our dismay, we found that the only sous vide cooking machines on the market were made for industrial labs or commercial kitchens, and the least expensive device was around $1,500 to $2,000. At the time, there was no device for the home cook, so we set about to make one. We assembled a team of designers, manufacturers, and culinary professionals and launched our dream to develop the first home sous vide machine, our original SousVide Supreme water oven, and to fulfill our mission to bring sous vide cooking to our home and to the masses.       Our SousVide Supreme has received international acclaim - check out what others have said:        ÃÂÃÂ     Our customers love their original SousVide Supreme. We're excited to see how much theyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>llÃÂÃÂ love the SousVide Supreme Touch+!ÃÂÃÂ        Professional chef's like Top Chef All-Star Richard Blais love the SousVide Supreme too:      Product Specifications:  Estimated Availability: March 2018  Product Price: $599  Finish: Stainless steel exterior and interior  Performance:   Double-wall insulation with cool-touch exterior means it is safe in your kitchen.ÃÂÃÂ   The Touch+ will be ETL certified for household use.ÃÂÃÂ   The SousVide Supreme Touch+ will cook approximately 20 four-ounce portions.ÃÂÃÂ   Precise temperature control results in perfectly cooked food, every time.ÃÂÃÂ   High-efficiency ""Edge to Edge"" heating systemÃÂÃÂ   Cooks everything from meat, seafood, poultry and eggs to desserts, yogurt, and even infused syrups and liquors.ÃÂÃÂ   Patented design with double wall insulation retains heat, making it highly energy efficient.ÃÂÃÂ   Because food is vacuum-sealed in food safe pouches, juices and nutrients are preserved during the cooking process.  ÃÂÃÂ Easy to useÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094>just set it and walk away. Low and slow, extended cooking times ensure food wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t ever be over- or under-cooked.ÃÂÃÂ   Even temperatures are maintained throughout the water bath without the need for a circulator motor.

Join us to become a SousVide Supreme Touch+ Kickstarter!       Risks and challenges  Eades Appliance Technology is a team with extensive manufacturing experience; we have been producing quality sous vide water ovens for nearly a decade. Specifically, our project benefits from the following key facts:   - We and our factory have a long history of designing and manufacturing quality products  - The SousVide Supreme Touch+ is the result of many months of detailed and careful planning so far  - We have previously designed and manufactured three different sous vide water ovens and sold them globally for eight years.  Despite our expertise and careful planning, there are risks to any project. We've identified and outlined the following key risks to our project below:  1. Excess Demand:  Our factory has large volume capacity and we do not project that this will be a problem. However, if demand were extraordinary, scheduling additional runs above our anticipated volume could delay our project.  2. Software Development:  Our company has not yet produced another appliance with connectivity, but we are partnering with a professional team with deep experience in building and developing connected devices and so we do not anticipate any problems. However, development of our connected device is currently largely conceptual. Despite the proficiency of the team, it is always possible that the development schedule could slip for reasons unforeseen at present and could cause a delay in delivery beyond the anticipated delivery date of March 2018.  3. Suppliers:  Our factory has long-standing relationships with suppliers and a robust supply chain for components. However, it is not always possible to predict a problem that could arise with a supplier and thus it is not impossible that our project might be delayed due to problems with a supplier outside our control."

(source: wikipedia)  The company will be registered in Estonia and the servers will be installed also there. The Estonian cryptography laws aren't restrictive, that's why Muonium will be deployed there.   Your data protected from governments.  Muonium uses cryptography to protect the privacy of the users. Our model is the  end-to-end encryption  which means that only the user (=you) will be able to access your files. To enter in the details, before uploading them (=the files), Muonium will encrypt them on your PC. Consequently even the Muonium team and governmental organizations wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t be able to access them.       The goal of the Muonium team is to make encryption as comprehensive and easily available as possible. Even if the user knows nothing about cryptography, he will still be able to use it safely while keeping his privacy up.        Our servers are running only on Gnu/Linux, especially the  Debian  distribution (Debian is an operating system made by a strong community), which is one of the best representations of what ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C> Free software ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ means, without forgetting that the Debian's community take with serious security issues. Consequently there isn't any backdoor in the operating system of the servers. They are not corrupted and have a strong internal security.   Everywhere, even in your pocket !       We're building a mobile and desktop application but currently only a web version is available. Only modern web browsers are advised to be used on Muonium. You will be able to access your files no matters where you are.   Losing data is a thing of the past.  The Muonium's infrastructure is designed to avoid any loss of data. Your data will be replicated three times in total. This means that if one nay two servers break down, your data will remain available.        We're humans! That's a community project!   Libre &amp; Opensource   We think building Muonium as a  free software  is the better way to move forward the knowledge in cryptography implementations, and it's also the better way to build a free Internet, where everybody can contributes and believes in a project. Because Muonium is OpenSource, everybody can trust the project and confirm that we don't lie when we say that Muonium is a safe place for your personal data.       Muonium is a free software and the core team will ask advice to the Muonium's community to take the best way. That means that even the users can say what they want or recommend something. We're very open-minded.       ( our GitHub repository )  We've chosen a crowdfunding because this is the more community way to reach the money required to launch correctly the project. We're very oriented to a community project.   Users can be fully involved!   In addition to being opensource and libre, our project is also very democratic. You can join our group on  Framavox  and make a proposal about anything, and then, other users (and we) will vote and will consider the submitted proposals. We want to build a community thanks to our  transparency and our openness.   Experts will be able to develop their own client!   We're currently developing an API, which will allow developers to create their own client for Muonium. In this way, customers will be able to choose any  third party  client provided by the community instead of the official clients made by the Muonium team.   Features       End-to-end encryption      Mobile and desktop applications (under development)       Files sharing by password (coming very soon)   Web applications to edit files at the client-side (planned)   Two-Passwords in one (under review)        The box (almost at the prototype stage)    A cloud at home  We plan to launch ""Muonium Gateway"", a box which can host Muonium independently of Muonium, but by one click, the box can be turned in a gateway.     Server mode    ÃÂÃÂ        Configured as a server, the user have just to put an external hard disk, and upload his files. It's like a Synology NAS, or Dlink, etc. But with an end-to-end encryption.    Gateway mode        ÃÂÃÂ   Thanks to this mode, you'll be able to upload your data without encrypting it on your device so files are uploaded faster. Consequently, since your device doesn't encrypt the files, you'll be able to listen music, watch movie directly...  To resume, the files are uploaded on the little box you have at home. The box encrypts the files, and sends it to the Muonium's servers. Like that, your data will be available even if the little box breaks down.   The Worksheet - 2017  Firstly, the money earned will allow us to create the company and buy and install servers in Estonia as soon as the crowdfunding done.  (Between July and September 2017)  Secondly, we'll improve the current design. We'll also go out our API first version and the official client for it.  (September 2017)  Then we will propose paid plans, with this the user will be able to get more storage space by paying, it's a way to contribute to the project. We'll spend this money in servers and the core team to make a living.  Next, we'll try to launch a little project, but not now, it's the ""Muonium Gateway"", a cube which hosts Muonium, with it you aren't dependent of the Muonium's infrastructure, the cube is your infrastructure.  (As soon as the crowdfunding gets done)  Finally, we will open an enterprise and premium accounts support. These support services will allow us to get money to buy more servers to provide more native storage space for free accounts. Companies will be able to install Muonium on their own servers, with or without the enterprise support.   Enterprise support  Contact us at g.ciliberti@protonmail.com for more information.   Thanks to  Thanks to these persons who helped us :   Arnaud: thanks for having started Muonium with us.    Quentin: thanks for having started Muonium with us.

Gwangmin Kim : thanks for your database structure plans.     Elmer Ibayan : thanks for your contributions as a part of the team.   And we also thank other people who are not mentioned here for privacy issues.   FAQ   How looks like the T-Shirt?        ÃÂÃÂ    Firstly... How am I supposed to pronounce that name?   Don't worry:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkDvWaBe9ms  . Call it ""Mui"", that's faster and cuter.   Too much details... What's Muonium?   Muonium is an  encrypted  cloud, your data are encrypted. Consequently, you remain the only one owner of your files, even governments cannot access them. Muonium is democratic: you can  make proposals , and say: ""Let's decide about this stuff together!"". Muonium is technically transparent: the code is  publicly available  by anyone who want to check it, so that you'll know if we're lying and to move forward the cryptography implementation on such a project. Without forgetting that you'll be able to install it on your own server, and then, you won't depend on our infrastructure.   Muonium is free, right?   Of course, that's one of the fundamental principles of Muonium. The user haven't to pay to keep his privacy. The free offer is natively 10GB, if you need more, you'll have to buy a paid plan, around 20ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬/month to get 1TB/month. With the time, if the enterprise and customers supports work fine, we'll be able to provide more native storage space for the free plans, from 10GB to 15GB nay 20GB.   Then, my files for sure cannot be read by any governmental organizations?   Technically speaking, the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>zero riskÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ doesn't exist. In the other hand, if a government asks us the users data we'll try to go against it. And without forgetting that even if a government takes some users data, these data will be encrypted.   I don't really understand the difference between you and the others cloud...   Firstly, Muonium is fully OpenSource, that's why if there's any security issue or backdoors put on purpose, the entire world will know, the technical side is totally transparent. Secondly, we implemented AES-256 (the encryption algorithm) with a strong mode: GCM, with this mode, AES-256 is one of the most secure algorithms in the world. And finally, we use an operating system which's one of the best about security.   Do you have a BitCoin (BTC) address I can donate to?   Yes of course! 1GxpepD3PzJ99S9nMboRbgHeG6ckzZHWJ   Can I invest in Muonium?   Yes, you can, by contacting us at paul.feuvraux@protonmail.com   What's Kantum Technologies?   Kantum Technologies is the future company, and Muonium is the project. By the way, it's a word play of Kant (the philosopher) and Quantum, which's the minimum of energy involved in an interaction.   Your website isn't really talkative contrary to your presentation...   Yes. We'll remake it later, for now we focus our whole development process on the cloud.      Risks and challenges  This project requires many servers, and then, if we don't have enough money we might not be able to give everybody an account."

They are a completely customizable way to organize your life. The only downside is that they are extremely time consuming and tedious. Bullet Journalers often find themselves sitting at desks for hours with rulers and colored pens slowly drawing out each page of their book. It's easy to see that this aspect of bullet journaling is contradictory to the intended goal of increasing productivity and organization.ÃÂÃÂ   This observation made me realize the true allure of bullet journals - customization. Every person is unique, everyone's life is unique, and therefore there should be nothing more unique than a journal; the very thing that is responsible to organizing your daily lifestyle.ÃÂÃÂ   This was the idea that spurred Younique Journals. Younique Journals is an interactive design website where users can create and customize every page of their journal using an easy drag and drop feature. Leveraging digital technology, pages and designs can be easily copied and modified, saving journalers hours of tedious work without having to sacrifice a personalized life style. Once a journal design is complete, users will be able to download and print their journal pages, all in the comfort of their own home. If desired, they can order a fully bound and printed journal from the store.  Finally, I hope to grow the website into a marketplace where designers can share their journal ideas for others to purchase and/or use in their creations.  Help me make Younique Journals a reality, because every day should be unique!

Pick up the next generation of   Raspberry Shake  ,  a personal home Earth monitor combined with IoT technologies made by    OSOP   , at a HUGE discount!  Our previous    Kickstarter campaign    was a resounding success- a Kickstarter Staff Pick that overshot its funding goal by 1,400%! Thanks to your support we brought you  Raspberry Shake, the worldÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s smallest professional-grade personal Earth monitoring device.  In recent years we have seen a huge rise in the popularity of home automation and local environmental monitoring devices. Every day, people are using more ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Home ScienceÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ solutions, such as weather stations, to better understand what affects their local environment. These solutions provide accurate information in real-time. Such home science devices measure what you feel and sense, such as the temperature or air quality. But what about things happening all around you that you donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t notice until perhaps it is too late, like earthquakes? Raspberry Shake deepens your connection to the surrounding environment by measuring local Earth movements, some too small to feel, others big enough to raise an alarm.  Since our last campaign we have listened to your feedback and we have been working nonstop to make the next generation of Raspberry Shake even better. We are proud to introduce the Raspberry Shake 4D.     And don't forget to follow us on social networks (@raspishake):  Facebook ,  Twitter ,  Instagram  and  Youtube .       The Raspberry Shake 4D gives people like you the ability to truly observe unseen vibrations that happen all around, as well as the big ones that really shake things up. These Earth movements affect us all in some way or another, the more serious ones hitting the news with increasing frequency. These movements are no longer limited to just ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>naturalÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ movements such as sinkholes, landslides and earthquakes. Human factors are becoming increasingly more apparent with quarry explosions, nuclear blast testing, deep well waste water injection and fracking, processes that have impacted many of our friends and relatives directly.  Recently the    Oklahoma    Geological Survey acquired 100 Raspberry Shakes for this very reason!       Until now, only government institutions with deep pockets could afford to monitor earthquakes. This all changed with the introduction of Raspberry Shake.ÃÂÃÂ   The Raspberry Shake 4D is a clever combination of technologies, conveniently fitting right onto the Raspberry Pi, the most popular single-board personal computer in the tech world, also making it a fantastic Raspberry Pi project for anyone who has one lying around!     We are currently working with Sorin Botirla, a backer of the original Raspberry Shake project, to develop a new and complementary web interface for all Raspberry Shake models       Raspberry Shake 4D electronic board with built-in MEMs accelerometers         We created the Raspberry Shake to empower hobbyists and promote home science and citizen scientists.  The Raspberry Shake succeeded in fulfilling its mission and over a 1000 units have been distributed worldwide to over 50 countries, leading to the creation of the largest citizen scientist earthquake monitoring  network  in history. Raspberry Shake also caught the attention of government institutions like geophysical and earthquake monitoring institutes, who have acquired Raspberry Shakes to densify their networks. This will enable them to detect earthquakes faster and with higher degrees of confidence.    Even if your home is not affected by earthquakes, there is always something to see. The Raspberry Shake, much to our surprise and delight, has proven itself as a robust tool for measuring earthquakes from halfway around the world. Earthquakes in Eastern Russia, for instance, have been measured by Raspberry Shake users in London and other far off places. Now with the Raspberry Shake 4D you can see it ALL and more! See almost double the range of vibrations, as compared to the original Raspberry Shake, and quadruple the quantity of data received. This means you can see so much more than just an earthquake! Now you can observe things even closer to home. See nearby construction, traffic movements and changes in rush hour, cheering crowds at local games or concerts, your washing machineÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s spin cycle and even noisy neighbors with thin walls!       So what are you waiting for? Become a Shaker today!             Station View     Every device that comes online gets added to the Raspberry Shake community. Data streams from each unit to the cloud forming a dense network of of highly sensitive Earth monitoring ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>stationsÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ. These work in unison to detect earthquakes which are later shared on a   mobile app   and   web platform  .   With the Raspberry Shake 4D we want you to get as much out of it as possible, even when you arenÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t at home or behind your computer. You will now be able to pair your Raspberry Shake 4D with   If This Then That  ( IFTTT ) protocol, to get instant notifications of any ground motion. Easily send updates or notifications of any Earth shakes to your phone, email or any social networks. For the geek in you, it doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t stop there! You can add endless other IFTTT compatible devices to connect with your Raspberry Shake 4D. How about connecting to your WeMo lighting or smart plug for example?!  So, for whatever reason you choose to buy a Raspberry Shake, whether itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s for the tech element, your love of seismology, for a Raspberry PI project, programming or just because it is cool - You can be part of this community where someone is always observing these invisible movements of the Earth and warning you of any unwanted surprises!     The Raspberry Shake 4D is the Ultimate IoT tech device for the next generation of Home Science Automated Monitoring.                          Thanks to feedback from backers from our last campaign and many of our existing customers including government institutes such as the Oklahoma Seismic Network in the USA and EMSC in Europe, we put all of our efforts of over a decade of experience in producing specialized seismic equipment into creating something remarkable - The next generation of Raspberry Shake, the   Raspberry Shake 4D  , integrates a 3-component accelerometer and dedicated Earth microphone (the geophone), into a clean sleek  design, providing more sensors and more data! Now you can capture earthquakes in all dimensions!      Seismometers and accelerometers measure the Earth as it shakes, breaks and grumbles in slightly different ways. Seismometers, the geophone element of the 4D, are well purposed for measuring small-to-medium sized local earthquakes but go off-scale for larger local (&lt;10km) and regional (&lt;100 km) earthquakes. Accelerometers remain on-scale. Even in Oklahoma, where the earthquakes are generally lower in magnitude (&lt; Magnitude 6 on the Richter scale) and for areas along big destructive faults, like those that pass by San Francisco, it is better to combine these technologies to ensure readings do not go off-scale. This is because in Oklahoma, as in many other earthquake-prone areas around the world, the earthquakes are typically very local and nucleate in shallow areas beneath population centers. With the Raspberry Shake 4D the accelerometers measure the EarthÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s motion in 3 dimensions, while our precision geophone adds another, to give you the largest scale and accuracy possible for any seismograph of its size and price - Now you can capture an earthquake in all of its glory!   Like the name suggests, the 4D has FOUR sensors. Combined with the geophone from the original Raspberry Shake, we have added 3 strong motion MEMs accelerometers to give the device a total of four recording channels.      Quadrupling the input sensors forced a redesign of the original Raspberry Shake. We went back to the drawing board and redesigned the Raspberry Shake circuit board to incorporate a processor that could not only cope with this extra data, but could double the quantity of data processed per second to measure a wider range of Earth motion. The circuit board of the Raspberry Shake 4D now incorporates four 24 bit digitizers, each sampling the EarthÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s motion at 100 samples per second (double its predecessor). We have also been able to boost the data transmission rate from one packet per second to four, which makes our latest version of the Raspberry Shake Earthquake Early Warning compatible.        ÃÂÃÂ In summary, enhancements from the original Raspberry shake include:          For more technical specifications click   HERE  .ÃÂÃÂ         Stay up to date with the latest Shakes happening around the globe with the EQ info app for your android phone, in the    Google Play store   .  The app gives you earthquake notifications with details such as magnitude, location, depth, precise time etc and shows them all on an interactive map.  The app receives data from numerous sources including the Raspberry Shake network, which means you can see your own device recording and sharing precision Earth motion to the global community.     EQ Info App     This application was developed by   Gempa GmbH  . We acknowledge and are grateful to these developers for their contributions to our project.        The Raspberry Shake 4D plugs right into the Raspberry Pi's header and combines sensor technologies that effectively double the range of what it can observe. Using a very sensitive Earth sensor, the geophone, coupled with micro-electromechanical (MEMS) accelerometers, we were able to extend the recordable range of ground motion by more than double and remain on scale when big earthquakes strike which would have saturated the original Raspberry Shake. The integration of our three component strong motion 2G MEMs accelerometers (similar to the kind you might find in your smartphone) make it possible for anyone to record strong and close motion activities without any saturation in all 3 dimensions (north-south, east-west, up-down).  The 4 sensors transmit continuous, real-time seismic data over the serial port at one packet/ 250 ms (or four times per second) where it is received by the data acquisition software preloaded onto the Raspberry Pi. From there, the data is forwarded to the Raspberry Shake Community Server where it is used for Earthquake detection and made available for anyone in the community to visualize using the brand new local graphical display interface and SWARM.ÃÂÃÂ   We have built in MANY ways for you to view your Shake's data natively from the Raspberry Pi, to your home computer via a web interface web interface  (click on any triangle in  stationView !), SWARM and mobile Android App.  All of the software development is nearly done. We are currently running tests to ensure that the NTP time-stamping is accurate to within +/- 10 ms of true time; that Earthquakes are properly detected and rendered; and expanding the entire cloud services ecosystem that was developed for the original Raspberry Shake for reception of the 4D data.           The Raspberry Shake 4D is a very hi-tech piece of kit and can see, measure and record the un-perceptible vibrations of the Earth to the big shakes that you can really feel.  It is a fantastic home science device to add to your home monitoring network, that citizen scientists and gadget lovers alike can enjoy. Here are a few ideas of the sort of things you can observe:       ÃÂÃÂ As you can see, it shows you so much more than just earthquakes!        The Raspberry Shake 4D has something for everyone. It is IoT technology at its best linking home science, citizen science, programming and cool gadgets in the best way possible.  We have designed the Raspberry Shake 4D to be as plug-and-play as possible, but for those of you who like to tinker a little more, there are tons of things you can do with it. From Raspberry Pi projects, to seismological observation, to programming, IFTTT integration, to just being more conscious about what's going on around you, the Raspberry Shake 4D makes all this possible for all skill levels.  For any of you who love the idea but are a little nervous about the tech side, we are here to help. We have an awesome community of ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>ShakersÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ and a team on standby for any eventuality.

Through previous engagements, our Master Craftswoman has worked with many of our prospective manufacturers in the past. As well as being produced on a smaller scale, this is the simplest product many of our team members have ever worked on, and it allowed us to focus on build quality.  We are confident and passionate about delivering quality goods. We have spent months designing and prototyping our products, executing pre-production runs to ensure we can meet our high standard. We have internally funded the design and production of our signature brass hardware. Our resources and team are based here in the United States, primarily on the East Coast, so we do not foresee any issues with our ability to deliver your new Oceanus Brass Bow-Shackle Pens upon successful funding of our project.  We will keep you up-to-date on the progress of production and let you know of any issues impacting our ability to promptly deliver your new Oceanus products, including steps we are taking to get back on track. We will do our best to manufacture locally as we have done to date, but may shift focus onto manufacturing overseas if doing so will result in delay avoidance or quality consistency. We stand ready to resolve any challenges to make sure you have a positive experience with our service and product!  Click on the Bow-Shackle above to chat with an Oceanus Brass Representative."

We have faced multiple challenges from engineering a new technology to even intense team experiences. However, we still consider following to be the most important challenges  1. Factory &amp; Production - With such an amazing initial response for GoDrive Pro at CES 2017, we realized matching the consumer demand of our product with the production supply is going to be a challenge. We got back from CES and started our home work. We started co-operating with the world's leading intelligent hardware production facility in Shenzhen, China. It was our conscious choice to choose the best hardware production provider. To ensure production capacity and yield, we even started considering multiple production units.  2. MFi Certification- Apple MFi (Made for iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch) certification requirements are extremely strict. From strict hardware, current supply, appearance, design, interface, application standards to an all-round test are the deciding factors for this certification process. Only 2% products end up getting this certification, all over the world. However, we have enough experience for the same. We have successfully applied twice for 2 of our previous products in the past. GoDrive ProÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s application has already been submitted to Apple in this regard. We believe GoDrive Pro will be MFI Certified soon. To guarantee the stability and safety for our customers, we made an incredibly beautiful app and started sourcing the original Apple Lightning Connectors (unlike the 3rd party ones) that provide the same experience as using an Apple's Official product.     3. Logistical Challenges - The last challenge is getting the products to each of our Kickstarter customers. There are strict restrictions on shipping single electronic products around the world today. However, our in-house logistics team has spent a considerable amount of time searching to find a logistical partner that has a proven track record of dealing with global logistical supplies.   Our team of designers, engineers, and management experts have successfully operated two hardware projects and have plenty of experience in handling a diverse range of problems. Even in an unexpected scenario, be rest assured that we'll keep you informed and work towards solving the problem quickly."

Secondly, owning an autonomous drone will change the way everyone sees and records outdoors adventures.In 2013, Edgars Rozentals and Agris Kipurs, business associates, were discussing the future of drones in their native country of Latvia. They realized the potential within the drone market and had a vision of removing the problem most drones had, which was the need of an operator and the inherent human error associated. The desire of these two founders to change that reality and their aspiration to leave office jobs was where the premise of AirDog emerged.While the idea of an autonomous drone seemed easy, the technical aspects proved very demanding. To tackle this challenge the team was able to bring on a technical leader in Ilya Nevdah who had a passion for drones and also wanted to change his career path. Ilya created a team that spent many months of development and testing to prove the concept being viable. It all came together on March 26th of 2014 when the first prototype was realized.After a successful prototype, the fundraising through Kickstarter began. This was the perfect platform that allowed the AirDog team to show their vision and give people who dreamed of an autonomous drone a chance to buy into the company.",2.0,2013-09-01 11:24:31 -0400,Backed 2 projects,KO,390,"WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re back and we owe it all to you Kickstarter community.

Proprietary algorithms utilize data from barometric air pressure sensor, accelerometer and GPS to allow for precise and accurate response to extreme elevation changes.        ÃÂÃÂ        Rather than a remote control with joysticks and large display screens, the ADII is controlled with AirLeash. Initiate takeoff and make quick inflight adjustments with the press of a button on AirLeash. The durable and light-weight, waterproof, tracking device allows for simple, mid-action control of the ADII while in action. The backlit LCD interface allows the user to read the display clearly in a broad range of lighting conditions.       ÃÂÃÂ        The ADIIÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s durable, weather resistant construction is powered by a high quality propulsion system providing superior tracking and camera control in high wind conditions up to 30knots (15m/s).        ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        User-programmed custom ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>Follow ModeÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ delivers ultimate control over desired creative aspects providing extreme levels of safety in areas such as single-track trails, cable wakeboarding and terrain parks, and anywhere else where you want your ADII to stay away from existing infrastructure, trees, buildings and other obstacles. In this mode, the ADII will fly along a pre-programmed flight path while still following and keeping you perfectly framed in the video shot.      ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        In open areas free of obstacles, these are the modes that let you get going instantly.  Fixed FollowÃÂÃÂ  Once you launched the ADII, position it in the desired angle relative to magnetic north and it will keep that angle/perspective, locked at all times, regardless of your movement or change in direction.  Adaptive FollowÃÂÃÂ  In this mode, the ADII will adapt to your movement direction. For example, the user can set the ADII shoot from the front with the camera pointing towards the subject at all times regardless of extreme changes in trajectory or terrain elevations. ÃÂÃÂ   CircleÃÂÃÂ  Want a more dynamic shot while cruising along the beach? Just hold left or right arrow button on AirLeash to command ADII to start circling around you while still following your movement.       ÃÂÃÂ        Scenic modes allow you to capture the amazing world around you, of course, hands-free and in perfect frame, every time. Five preset scenic capture modes allow you to document the world around you. Flight and camera movements are synchronized to provide a unique and perfectly timed shot.      ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Landing is completely automated and is initiated when the battery level runs low or when you manually send a command from the AirLeash tracking device. The ADII can land either a few feet from your current position or fly back to it's original takeoff position.       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ        Every sport brings it's own set of unique challenges. The AirLeash interface is packed with 11 Sport/Action presets (Race Track, Trail, Wake Cable, Backcountry, Behind a Boat, Snow Park, DH Skiing, Surf/Sup, Windsurf, Kiteboard, Skate Park) providing tailored settings and safety features to ensure the best video capture and flight safety.        ÃÂÃÂ        With the guidance of algorithms, camera is aimed at the subject, in perfect frame, at all times. The AirLeash tracking device is packed with multiple sensors for accurate position and real-time motion sensing. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s GPS data is fused with readings from 9-axis IMU sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer) and barometric pressure sensor and transmitted to the drone  in real-time. The combination of unique motion prediction technology and intelligent follow algorithms designed for sports allows for advanced high-precision tracking in the most challenging elements.       ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ To ensure vibration-free, smooth and professional grade video footage, the ADII has a built-in gimbal for GoPro HERO 5 Black camera.  Powered by three brushless motors, the gimbal has the ability to keep the camera level on all axes no matter how the drone is flying. Highly advanced video stabilization system/gimbal provides smooth, professional grade footage when operating in extreme weather conditions. The gimbal adapter also charges your GoPro, so there is one battery less to charge. The new auto start/stop record feature engages during take-off and landing to ensure capture every time, automatically.

The prototype will be the basis for further productions of exclusive boards. Every board will be tailor made to meet the customer's every wish in both design and performance. Every produced board will be made in very close relation with the customer.  The prototype deck will be made by hand by Peter Jarl at  Hollow Frame . Peter will be building the deck from the beautiful wooden material Paulownia. Every deck that will be built will be totally unique with focus on design and craftsmanship. Further down you can watch a video of how Peter creates his boards.The picture below is a Paulownia deck without the electrical components.       Many confuses an electric skateboard with a toy like an Airboard. An electric skateboard is far from a toy. It's the perfect commuting vehicle.The goal is to create boards that doesn't compromise range, speed and of course design. With the right configuration our board will reach speeds of up to 45km/h and range over 25km.  If we reach or goal on Kickstarter the next step will be to build the prototype board and evaluate it. When the evaluation process is complete we will start taking orders and production will begin. When everything is up and running we will also offer to make electric skateboards from our customers own boards.       There are 4 different levels to support the project. If we donÃÂÃÂ´t reach the goal of 12 000 SEK  NO MONEY  will be charged from your account.   LEVEL 1 . You pledge between 1 - 99 SEK. You will unfortunately not receive more than our gratitude. No pledge is to small.   LEVEL 2 . You pledge between 100 - 499 SEK. You will get your name printed on the prototype board. You will also be invited to the big demo day in Helsingborg where you will be able to test the board yourself and also be treated with some refreshments in great company.         LEVEL 3 . You pledge between 500 - 999 SEK. You will get your face printed on the prototype board. You will also be invited to the big demo day in Helsingborg where you will be able to test the board yourself and be treated with some refreshments and great company.         LEVEL 4 . You pledge 1 000 SEK or more. This is for you, who really like the project or would like to have an exclusive board yourself. We will be building a board based on your demands. You only pay for the parts and maybe shipping costs. Should you choose a Hollow Frame deck, then Peter will sign it and number it for you. And you will of course be one of the honored guests at the demo day in Helsingborg.  ÃÂÃÂ        SAFETY  You should always learn at slow speeds. Always wear a helmet and your personal protective gear in case anything happens. Ride within your limits and always put your and others safety first.   LEGALITY Laws and regulations regarding electric vehicles, and electric skateboards, vary by country, state, county, and municipality, so please check the local legal status of this product before you Ride it!      Risks and challenges  Since production of the boards will be in very close relation with the customer and focus will be on design and performance, customers won't be able to just buy a board from a webshop. That means every board will have its unique production time which in turn may at first have impact on delivery times.  At first we might not be able to deliver boards that needs to be transported by airplanes to the customer or a pledger.This is due to airline regulations on sending big batteries which makes it to expensive."

I am also interested in science, which made this project so much fun.  These work fairly simply. You take a piece of tender or char cloth and put it in the recess of the piston. Insert the piston into the handle and strike the piston end firmly to compress it fully. I usually hit it against a log. The heat generated from the compression will usually ignite the tender and give you an ember which you can nurse into a flame with a tender bundle. Sometimes it will take multiple strikes, especially if extremely cold.      Risks and challenges  The risk is minimal as I own the machine tools and will make these myself.

Never  ascendÃÂÃÂ to the surface without releasing air from your lungs to avoid Over Lung ExpansionÃÂÃÂ    Pulmonary Barotrauma:  During rapid ascent  the air in the lungs expand, causing lung over expansion and rupture releasing bubbles into the bloodstream.

PRESSURE AFFECTS MANY ASPECTS OF DIVING ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ  EqualizationAs a diver descends , the pressure increase causes the air in their body's air spaces to compress. The air spaces in their ears, mask, and lungs become like vacuums as the compressing air creates a negative pressure. Delicate membranes, like the ear drum, can get sucked into theses air spaces, causing pain and injury. This is one of the reasons that a diver must equalize their ears for scuba diving.On ascent, the reverse happens.ÃÂÃÂ    Decreasing pressure  causes the air in a diver's air spaces to expand. The air spaces in their ears and lungs experience a positive pressure as they become overfull of air, leading to a pulmonary barotrauma or a reverse block. In a worst case scenario this could burst a diver's lungs or eardrums.To  avoid a pressure-related injury  (such as an ear barotrauma) a diver must equalize the pressure in their body's air spaces with the pressure around them.To equalize their air spaces on descent a diver adds air to their body airspaces to counteract the ""vacuum"" effect by breathing normally , this adds air to their lungs every time they inhaleadding air to their mask by breathing out their noseadding air to their ears and sinuses by using one of several ear equalization techniquesTo equalize their air spaces on ascent a diver releases air from their body air spaces so that they do not become overfull bybreathing normally, this releases extra air from their lungs every time they exhaleascending slowly and allowing the extra air in their ears, sinuses and mask to bubble out on its ownManuel will be included how to use properlyÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ When purchasing the Dive Portable Lungs Kit you understand that you are  using it at your own risk. fully understand the risks and challenges of diving READ over FAQ and Manuel 'Included with package'        ÃÂÃÂ    https://www.instagram.com/diveportablelungs/ https://www.facebook.com/diveportablelungs/        Risks and challenges  I have spent so much time working on this product.

Practically undrinkable. Unprepared for such an eventuality, you believe that your only options now are to either find a fridge to put the drink in and wait, seek out an ever-elusive handful of ice cubes, or simply throw it out...right? Well, no longer!    Our Idea  Our vision is to create a straw that is freezable, reusable, and portable so that no one has to go without a cold beverage, regardless of where they are or where they're going. Currently, there are products on the market which can keep drink cold for long periods of time(such as insulated tumblers) and separately, products for making a drink cold (like reusable icepacks) but no options for a product which does both and is small enough to travel with ÃÂÃÂ you anywhere. By combining the already well-established technology used in insulated tumblers and that which is used in re-freezable icepacks, we can create a prototype for a travel and Eco-friendly straw capable of not only making drinks cold but keeping them cold for up to 24 hours.ÃÂÃÂ   Materials and Technology  Our design for the North Pole straw prototype consists of an inner straw tube made of cold-conducting stainless steel, fused at the top and bottom with an outer straw tube made of non-conductive acrylic, with a layer of liquid freezing agent contained in the space between. The type of freezing gel we will use in our final prototype will be decided only after some experimentation and the materials in this early design are subject to change as we flush out what works and what doesn't.  The Dream Team  Michelle Clarke, Robin Bouweiri, and Kim Kelly are three alumni to be from VCU's School of the Arts in Richmond, VA, the birthplace of the North Pole Straw project. As a team, our strengths lie in our innovative ability, collaborative effort, and ambition when it comes to bringing our product off the drawing board and into the real world.  Expenditures for Prototype Construction   Ordering materials for current prototype design from pre-selected manufacturers    Funds for extra materials to test for possible future iterations    Equipment and materials required for prototype assembly    Possible outside consultation on engineering principles for construction    Research/testing for product safety, environmental impact, and product life       Risks and challenges  While the North Pole straw's theoretical design rest comfortably on what we already know about cold-retention technology, there is always a reasonable chance for early set backs in production so we ask our supporters to be prepared for a slight bit of flexibility in our schedule should that happen.  Funding: Because we are hoping to create something that will involve freezing chemicals and a proper container for them, making it as safe as we intend for it to be could mean underestimating our budget in the long run."

I have a business studies and finances certificate acquired through Tafe, a requirement for a builders licence. I have a background in laboring work, from the manufacture and installation of garden sheds, tubular and steel picket fencing and sheet fencing to carports and verandah's. I began working for my farther when I was 8 years old, welding door frames for garden sheds. In my late teens and early 20's I worked as a laborer at my father's retail steel outlet at which time I also gained a considerable amount of experience in sale's and customer relations. Most recently over the past 10 years I have worked as a laborer, loading chilled pig carcasses onto trucks ( night shift ), where I also gained experience in record keeping for product standards and liaising with truck operators.  About The Product  I'm currently raising capital in order to bring into development a website where participants use camera and microphone kit's they have purchased from my company to stream their life from their home, car and their person live 24 hours a day. The site will utilize Adsense so that content up loaders are paid in the same way YouTube pay's it's up loader's, giving the up loader incentive to come aboard beside's the novelty effect of the idea and the social network feature. As I mentioned above ""on your person"", refer's to wearing a small microphone and the smallest possible camera typically attached to the top of the arm with a Velcro strap, similar to the body cameras the police use.  Done right the potential is there to build something as used as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter or Amazon and it's only a matter of time until someone build's this particular service.ÃÂÃÂ This Kickstarter campaign is very basic in appearance as this is the first attempt at raising capital and I have very little of my own funds to invest. For this reason I have also used the provided video to pitch my work ethic rather than pitch the product description. I haven't gone into a large amount of detail about the user interface and associated options, I will start by building the best possible service through a developer and overtime as most websites do, I will perfect the service.  Website Interface  The website will contain 6 main pages and a number of other required pages for various abilities and settings. Ease of use with a large amount options is a positive the site will attribute.   ÃÂÃÂ 1) Footage page will have a number of video boxes containing whats currently being up loaded by the up loader. Plus video boxes of the uploaded content by the up loaders selected favorite up loaders. All video boxes sizes will be able to be changed, so that for example if your operating with a large screen you can set multiple video boxes to a large size or on a small screen 1 or 2 large video boxes. On this page their will also be a chat function and the option to have a social network news feed displayed. Up loaders will have the ability to talk to each other using their camera's and microphone on this page.    2) Design options for the up loader as to what viewers will see when their on the up loaders page.    Users who don't upload content will be able to have similar pages to the above.    3) Search page for finding up loaders    4) Main social network    5) Store, for the purchase of cameras and microphones etc.    6) Online shopping center. Once the site is complete with a designated number of users my intention is to provide the worlds largest shopping center / complex online, in conjunction with real world business's, utilizing virtual reality technology and the ability to go shopping with an avatar of yourself and your friends or family with or without using virtual reality technology. ÃÂÃÂ    Social Network Abilities  There will be a built in social network called EL with a news feed and the best possible associated option's, I will include the ability for the audience to have the opportunity to communicate with up loaders in real time with moderated Twitter feeds, live Q&amp;A and chat.  EL will allow the poster of content to have their post's shared to everyone's news feed world wide or just with their friends, users will also be able to control what they see on their timeline from the posts of public around the world to just their friends. Their will also be options from both perspectives allowing to only share or see posts from particular countries, or to only share or see posts from males or females. There will be an option to have yourself rated by users on scale of 1 to 10 in appearance, personality and other traits, allowing for another option of who see's your posts or who's posts you see in your news feed which will be a handy / fun option having a world wide news feed ability.  I want to push the boundaries when it comes to socializing, for example I will incorporate a service that will recognize a fellow user of the website when they are nearby and allow you to add that person to your friend list or follow their activity on the website, either whilst using the product in your home, car or when you are using the body cam in a public area.  When your out in public, using the interface on your phone, your phone would allow for for example if you come in the vicinity of an individual that also uses the product, the option of having a notification sent to your phone that say's that the other person is there and you'll have the option of adding the person to your friend list or simply following their activities within the website.ÃÂÃÂ   Anyone you are in a near vicinity with will also be saved in the website for you to look up at a later time. A advertising avenue I will utilize is incorporating facial recognition software for the purpose of allowing my websites users to suggest to other people through Facebook to connect with my product, for example if a user from my website likes the look of someone they pass in public whom doesn't use my website but uses Facebook, than my websites user can send a suggestion to the Facebook user through Facebook asking the person to follow my user on my website. ÃÂÃÂ   Public Benefit  I expect the service at time's will prove to be an exceptional tool in crime prevention and crime recording. The public instinctively wants to assist in the prevention of crimes when they can, being able to assist in this area is a selling point I will utilize to a degree in advertisement of my product.  Advertising Benefits  Over time I want to push the boundaries when it comes to advertising from the perspective of offering a endorsement service, where by up loaders can apply to companies through the web site for an endorsement arrangement. But at the present time, I will push the boundaries from the perspective of targeted advertising through recognition technology, for example using recorded conversation and video enabling the delivery of related advertisements to the up loader and to the viewer item's related to the up loaders content. Which will work in well with the online shopping center / complex when it's implemented.  Funding  I have set the funding goal to $30,000 in order to provide funding for website development, app development and a small amount of advertising. Advertising which I will be seeking further funding for at a later stage is going to be a key part to a successful progression of the development process. I will also be seeking further funding in order to cover the initial cost's associated with developing camera and microphone kit's which will include a receiver / system that connect's to your TV and PC / laptop. As the kit's will be paid for by the up loader there will only be development cost's involved. I have set the funding goal to a low level of $30,000 yet I am hoping to surpass that substantially and eliminate the need to run another campaign. ÃÂÃÂ   The service provided will always be free of charge, I will make a profit by running advertisements and through commission in the shopping center / complex. If you have any questions or comments I can be contacted by email at mccmat863@yahoo.com      Risks and challenges  Being limited initially by capital is a challenge that has the potential to effect successful progression, as a strong advertising campaign will be heavily relied upon. The success of the website all comes down to people knowing about it, the websites usability, interface design and abilities rely on my common sense and along with other leading website owners like Jeff Bezos (Amazon) and Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) I want to push my website to it's full potential. There is no other service like what I'm building and filling the gap in the online market is something that assists with making websites very successful. I have used YouTube documentaries to gain an understanding of how large companies such as Facebook and Apple have progressed from their starting point's, which has provided me with the knowledge that Facebook may have only succeeded because of the way it was rolled out.   Another challenge that has to be taken into consideration is the initial cost's involved for up loaders to purchase my camera and microphone kit's. I don't intend on making a profit from these sales in order to keep the prices as low as possible and the camera and microphone kit store within the website will be offering the ability for up loaders to build their kits / setup larger over time."

I believe my 15 years of military service makes me a great candidate to lead my first business idea through to its fullest potential.",1.0,2019-04-14 02:50:35 -0400,Backed 0 projects,"Portland, OR",KO,"My name is Johnathan Vigil and I was born and raised in San Jose, Ca (Silicon Valley). During my time as a high school student, I fell in love with theater, which grew into a passion for film. The ability to feel raw emotion through cinema became a focal point for me and developed a desire within me to create film. However, in 2004 (Prior to graduating high school) I made the selfless decision to enlist into the United States Army. During my military service, I served in a variety of major commands as a human resources specialist. This occupation allowed me to understand large organizational structures. In addition, I was able to analyze, interpret, and apply regulatory guidance within the organization. My 15-year military career has developed key traits within me for managing projects and working in diverse settings. It is at this stage of my life that I begin to slowly transition out of my military career. I am soon preparing to enter a new chapter in my life and that is entrepreneurship. I believe that by combining my passion for cinema and my organizational professionalism I can help fix a major problem that affects the cinema industry today. That issue is the movie ticket subscription service plans. Movie ticket subscription plans have become increasingly popular over the past year; however, they have had many setbacks. This issue along with increasing ticket prices have led to a decline in theater attendance.  I am a husband; parent, friend, and coworker and I have always enjoyed watching the newest blockbuster films with others. There is a level of excitement when you have waited months to get the crew back together for a night out at the movies. I remember the ""good old days"" when I would call up my girlfriend (Now wife) and say, ""Let's go to the movies"". When we would go, we would be disappointed that the film we wanted to see was sold out. How about now? I mean in this fast pace life how easy is it NOT to have the ability to plan date night, family night, guys night out, or girls night out? What if we could take the hassle of planning a night out at the movies and replace it with convenience and safety? What if you could not only plan your movie night, but plan safe transportation to/from your locations? What about planning what to eat either before or after your movie? What if you could take those shareable moments at the movies and relive them as you watch your film again when it is released for digital download? Perhaps you are so into your film you want to read the book, listen to the soundtrack, or even collect the movie memorabilia. Matter of fact you are that movie junkie that enjoys films so much you want to rate, blog, and review upcoming films so that others can share in that emotional moment you yourself experienced. So what if we could stop hassling with multiple mobile applications and just plan our movie night through one central application? No need for multiple charges or multiple profile builds, or even multiple back and forth questions about the movies. No longer do you have to be frustrated because CREDITs will soon to be available for limited users.  Introducing CREDITs, which is an interconnected subscription, based service that connects six services through one central application feature. The six supported services are Cinema, Ride Share, Eatery (Dining), Digital Download, Item (Memorabilia), and Trailer services. This model surrounds its core feature, which is event oriented (such as going to a movie, but later we will be expanding to concerts and other social events) and will allow a user to build an event itinerary around such an event. Users can plan transportation and dining experiences around their core event using this one service while expanding that experience using complimentary services. By adding a scheduled ride share service and dining locations near their assigned theater, a user can take the hassle out of event planning and replace it with convenience and safety. Users subscription tier will provide them with the core feature while also providing discount credits, which can be used to enhance their experience.  My goal is to raise funding which will allow me to finance the first round of building this idea into a company. Your seed money is of the upmost importance to me and because I know what working hard for your money means. I also know what it is like when you see it dissolve with nothing to show for it. All donors can expect a monthly situation report on the project along with a quarterly report of how funds are being utilized so that there is full transparency. Once funding has been fully secured in the first round the first step will to be legally file our trademark and file for patent pending status. This will occur within the first 30 days of securing funds. I will complete this step by hiring a professional trademark and patent attorney. Once the provisional patent has been issued, by the USPTO funding will then be released to design the first mobile application prototype. This will be done using a professional third party application designer and developer. Once the prototype has been completed we will release funding to start our first round focus group which will consist of a sample size of four groups each with 250 people (varying ages). There will be one sample group in each of the four major cities we plan to launch CREDITs in which are: Los Angeles, CA; Huston, TX; Chicago, IL; and New York City, NY. This will give us user interface feedback and insight into whether or not this application has solved a variety of problems linked to the movie watching experience. Once the results of the focus group has been analyzed and shared our company will secure a second round of funding which will be phase two of building CREDITs into a major game changer in the movie ticket subscription service. The goal is to soft launch starting on August 20, 2020 (One year) with a full launch starting on August 20, 2021. This will help pace the company out to the market so the company does not burn raised capital.  I have researched all major movie subscription services that are currently in the market and I have found one common mistake. Each competitor grew faster than the company could sustain its own service. This led to a fast cash burn rate and constant changes in the companyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s terms of service agreement. In the end, this resulted in high customer attrition rates and poor customer experience. These companies also failed to collaborate with key companies, which could have helped a customer, have a richer experience. This also caused the companies to focus solely in one area and that is acquiring subscribers who are loyal to their own brand. My subscription service model is different and not meant to single out any theater chain or subscription service, but rather to reset the entire field and give movie chains the ability to fill theater seats. These seats would otherwise go unused and create a deficit in ticket sales. Low-ticket sales also would lead to low foot traffic at theater concession stands. My service plan and mobile application can create fair and open options to moviegoers everywhere.  I do plan to use round two funding to secure important partnerships with major companies. This will help drive customer traffic to our application and even reduce customer acquisition cost. Additionally, all revenue generated from each partnership will be reinvested in to the company and used to build out their corresponding area of the mobile application. Because I plan to limit the amount of subscribers during each trial run this will reduce the cash burn rate and allow us to plan for maximum liabilities taken on by the company and investors.  When I first came up with the idea of CREDITs it was because I allowed myself to forget what it was like to plan a date night with my beautiful wife. In addition, I saw how families were affected by the unaffordable price tag that a movie night brought. I can see how the changes in alcohol consumption at the theaters can be a catalyst for DUI or even severe injury when out with friends. I saw that I could help bring the movies back to the movie watchers. This is why CREDITs needs your support and with it, I know we can change the way we go to the movies!      Risks and challenges  I do have the upmost confidence in seeing this idea through to a company and onto a family of employees who have a goal in seeing, everyone back out and at the movie theaters. However, I must be clear in stating that in order for this idea to be fully attainable I must break the funding into two phases so that I can limit risk for all investors. Each phase is meant to accomplish a small goal so that the struggles of growing too fast or becoming too complicated does not kill the company. Some of the hurdles that we can encounter is failure to have a full patent in less than 24 months. Another hurdle can be the timeline that the mobile application is completed. Additionally, the focus group may not return favorable results, which could affect timeline for soft launch. Finally, if the technology cannot be produced or the partnerships with other companies cannot be attained then the ability to have a full functional application can be jeopardized, which means as the founder I will have a moral duty to halt further movement. I kindly seek your pledge and this is why your seed money will always be recognized on our company's landing page. Without your investment, this company would fail to exist. Please invest with caution and understanding that this is a risk, but worth the reward."

ÃÂÃÂ However, they do create risk. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ     Each network connected device in your home creates a target for hackers or automated 'malware'. ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ These devices are poorly protected and incredibly easy to hack, making them prime targets for hackers.    Once a device is infected, it becomes a jumping off point to watch, listen, capture your information and control these devices. ÃÂÃÂ Your information and data can be send anywhere in the world, and you will have no idea it's happening. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ  Your firewall, cable company and anti-virus programs don't protect you from these threats.

ÃÂÃÂ We have developed products specifically to protect you against these attacks on your privacy and security. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ     Winner of multiple Innovation awards.ÃÂÃÂ ( Mass Innovations - Best Product, New England Business Association - Innovation Technology Finalist, CEDIA - Innovation Alley [Custom Electronics Design and Installation Association)    A pledge of $29 for a Guard Dog Lite can start protecting your home, apartment, or office.

ÃÂÃÂ After a few frustrating hours of home network setup, the camera was streaming live feeds to his phone. ÃÂÃÂ Always curious and a veteran of cybersecurity work for large companies, ÃÂÃÂ he decided to monitor the network traffic flowing in his home. ÃÂÃÂ What he discovered was shocking. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ All of the devices in his home were sending data to various servers around the world. ÃÂÃÂ There was no way to tell what communication was valid and what devices might have already been compromised by hackers. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ He searched for a reasonably priced, consumer friendly solution, but came up empty.ÃÂÃÂ   Thus,  Guard Dog by A Cloud of My Own  was born. ÃÂÃÂ Our goals our straightforward. ÃÂÃÂ    Keep you safe from hackers gaining access to the IOT devices in your home. ÃÂÃÂ Once the have access to one or more of these devices, they can monitor audio, visual and activities in your home. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ They become embedded inside of your home.ÃÂÃÂ     Make the device  incredibly simple to install .ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ     Make setup of the Guard Dog safe. ÃÂÃÂ By eliminating the separate app to setup and maintain your security devices, your Guard Dog is dramatically safer. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Security setup through the  Guard Dogs built in screen eliminates the risk of the App (or the App connection points) from being hacked or compromised.  ÃÂÃÂ The app connection points are like a door to the control room. ÃÂÃÂ Even if it has a lock, it presents an incredibly high risk target to compromise your home. ÃÂÃÂ     Allow it to be added to your  existing network without disrupting it . ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ No need to throw out everything you have already.    Provide the protection that Enterprise Companies have, at a fraction of the cost.   We are focused on protecting you, your family and your home from hackers taking advantage of the poor security in the vast majority of IOT devices that are on the market today.ÃÂÃÂ      Sample display of where your smart home devices have been 'chatting'.  How would you know if this are expected or an intruder collecting data in your home or apartment?     Simplify and Automate Installation   By simplifying installation (with a built-in touchscreen and no need to download and connect through a separate app), we have trained the Guard Dog to automatically create an  optimal, secure, separate Wifi network  in your home. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   Unlike other network security devices, your Guard Dog has a built-in Touch Screen Interface. ÃÂÃÂ It will guide you through the safe and simple way to add Internet of Things(IOT) and Smart Devices to your home.ÃÂÃÂ   Many of the most basic 'open external doors' in a home network setup occur due to misconfiguration. ÃÂÃÂ Install and setup are unnecessarily difficult because the systems are too 'tech folk' oriented. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    Straight Forward Approach to IOT Security   Reading most marketing material on security devices is entertaining. ÃÂÃÂ It sometimes feels like a magical potion, mix this and that ( Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are some common ones) , and magically all of your challenges are over.ÃÂÃÂ   We do have AI and ML in our solution, but let focus on the basic approach that we use. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ It is straightforward and you can see how what we are doing makes sense. ÃÂÃÂ There are 4 major functions that we perform to keep you and your ""things"" safe.   Isolate    Identify    Profile    Protect    Isolate   First, we automatically create a secure wifi network in your home connected to your existing network. ÃÂÃÂ Through our expertise in security, we automate the whole task. ÃÂÃÂ The  Guard Dog  senses and analyzes your current network and then configure the optimal network for your smart things. ÃÂÃÂ Once its complete, ÃÂÃÂ All the information you need to begin connecting your devices to your secure network is right there on the screen. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   No need to download another app, try and connect to the device, configure and then reboot and try to reconnect to the device. ÃÂÃÂ (By the way - having the setup controlled via an app creates a whole new set of security risks. ÃÂÃÂ By having the devices core configuration managed on the Guard Dog itself, the setup is inherently more secure.   Identify   As Internet of Things / Smart Home devices are added to the A Cloud of My Own secure network, they are immediately under the protection of the Guard Dog. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ As devices are added, the  Guard Dog  will prompt you to approve the addition to your home. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ This prevents a common method where malicious programs and malware attempt to 'hop onto' your network. ÃÂÃÂ This is known as 'Positive Acknowledge'. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Only when you are at home acknowledging the addition of the device, will it be allowed into your network.ÃÂÃÂ   As it is added, A Cloud of My Own's large proprietary database of IOT device behavior is used by the Guard Dog to determine the devices expected behavior. ÃÂÃÂ    Profile   The Guard Dog and A Cloud of My Own work together to monitor, learn and validate multiple dimensions of your IOT / Smart Home devices behavior. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ These extremely powerful technologies combine to create continuously learning, incredibly strong, layers of always on cyber protection.   Protect   Now your Guard Dog is continuously prowling and protecting your Smart Home. ÃÂÃÂ Any attempts to communicate with inappropriate or potentially dangerous systems around the world will be stopped. ÃÂÃÂ Attempts to inject malware onto unprotected 'things' is blocked. ÃÂÃÂ If a 'Thing' appears to be compromised, the Guard Dog will prevent only hackers 'channel' from being used, and you will be notified if you have requested.

Project Timeline / Milestones:ÃÂÃÂ     Development got underway in the Fall of 2017, with the First bench test units available in the Spring of 2018. ÃÂÃÂ   Leveraging open source security projects - like  Zeek  - a security product which was started in 1995 - built and supported by such talented organizations as Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the National Science Foundation, International Computer Science Institute and National Center for Supercomputing Applications, we have created a production ready, highly tested security product.  At this point, it became obvious to the team that we needed to make this solution very scalable, in order to provide the best solutions to our future customers. ÃÂÃÂ We determined that we needed a scalable solution for developing, testing and deploying code to the devices distributed around the world. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   In September 2018, we completed our port from native code into GitHub, docker and Resin.io. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ This provides a secure, controlled method to perform iterated product development in a safe, secure, repeatable method.  The link below commemorates our movements of the entire product into this new environment. ÃÂÃÂ This was a huge leap towards making this product scale for our customers.  https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6451992114057265152   Early Functionality Demo During User Testing - Fall 2018ÃÂÃÂ   So very rough looking looking back.

Based on test feedback, we have added a 'notch' to the case.  This makes connecting the device (which was already simple, even earier).      Update (May 2019)  We have created a low cost, no subscription variation of the Guard Dog product, called Guard Dog Lite. ÃÂÃÂ    Guard Dog Lite will monitor your smart home / home wireless network and report any security or potential privacy issues it finds with your home or office.ÃÂÃÂ     Provides active monitoring of your smart home / home automation devices, and reports abnormal behavior to you.ÃÂÃÂ     Ongoing reports available for you to review a complete review of your smart home devices - security, privacy, and other critical details that you would never know.

We are continuing to adjust the User Interface/User Experience on the Guard Dog to ensure that is remains easy and straight forward for non technical users.   Our goal is to eliminate the 'magic' and 'mystery' in security devices for you, and through our built-in touchscreen give you only as much or as little information as you want.      Securely patching devices once they are in your home is a huge challenge in the security space for Smart Homes and Internet of Things devices.  Through our experience is managing tens of thousands of medical applications running simultaneously on user owned devices throughout the world, we have build in the ability to securely update the Guard Dog in a very secure, efficient manner.   This will allow us to continue to keep you safe as new threats emerge and to continue to improve your user experience with the Guard dog.   On the manufacturing side, our main risk is in managing the supply chain of parts to ensure that we can assemble and ship to match demand.  To mitigate this risk, the Guard Dog is built using high quality, commercially available parts.     Because the threats continue to evolve, the team will be continuously researching, testing and enhancing our product.   The team has worked together on many corporate security projects and ensuring regulatory security compliance compliance since before the original HIPAA regulations were made law in the US. From HIPAA, PCI and High Trust - we understand how to secure technology environments."

The product is entirely safe and made in France.   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ABOUT ME  ÃÂÃÂ  I was a maintenance technician for 6 years and if I had to sum up the job I would say ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>To every problem a solutionÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ. And thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s what I told myself when in June, my friend asked me if it was smart to walk around with a brand new 1100ÃÂ¢<U+0082>ÃÂ¬. After our chat, I made a quick sketch and bought a silicon phone case, some rope, a glue gun and made this first prototype. Despite the defaults it helped me learn a lot : silicon is unusable because it serapes the case from the phone. I then got a hold of a small 3D printer. The first prototype in rigid form is here and now after 3 months of testing I decided to quit my job to fully invest myself in my project. After 6 months and more than 200 prototypes, I am now able to make any type of phone case.ÃÂÃÂ           You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

REWARDS DELIVERY       The rewards will be delivered during August and September so you can fully enjoy the product during the post-summer activities.        HOW TO HELP   ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ Any feedback, advice or criticism are much appreciated. The product will most likely change throughout the years and you be a part of it.    Some upgrades IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m thinking about : a bumper, fabric inside the case, a mini logo printed on the back of the case and a stainless steal hook made by a French craftsman.ÃÂÃÂ     ABOUT FUNDING   ÃÂÃÂ The funding will help me purchase a industrial 3D printer. It has a big adhesion surface, high precision and multiple possible extrusions, colors and materials. Thanks to itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>sÃÂÃÂ big surface, it will be possible to print more than 10 cases at the same time.ÃÂÃÂ     I will also need to invest in a 3D scanner to have an easier and more precise sketching.

Diam: 0.5mm    WHY THIS PROJECT   Since the very beginning of this project and every time I spoke about it, people would tell me it was a great idea. My objectives were to make a product that doesnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t exist, made in France and most of all a good product accessible for everyone. But eventually , I was faced with a problem : the delocalisation of French phone case making industries. After some thinking, I decided to start experimenting with additive manufacturing. Surprised with the possible outcome with good quality impression, I realized that additive manufacturing has itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s place in this industry.    With NowFalls and your backing, I hope to help stop pickpocketing and the chances of dropping your phone but I also want to proove the ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>industry worldÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ that you can produce for cheap and stop delocalisation!       Risks and challenges  The most obvious risk would be that the idea or use of the product does not interest people. Then it would be that I might not get the full financing. In terms of the challenge it would be to fall behind on the delivery of the rewards"

The moment that really changed my life was when I was diagnosed with a curable thyroid cancer around the same time that my father developed cancer.  Since then I have shifted gears to researching several fields related with medicine.  I stumbled on a new technique to target cancer cells using radio waves and gold nanoparticles, AKA the Kanzius Machine.  Since that time I have always wanted to integrate a smaller version of the technology to several other industries that can benefit substantially.

ÃÂÃÂ Climbing the highest peak, hiking the most difficult trail, sailing the longest stretch of ocean, and exploring the deepest reaches of the unknown in space all benefit from technology that harnesses the physical elements of nature to allow a pioneer to survive, breaking the physical boundaries. ÃÂÃÂ The waterproof   portable radiowave heat generator   sets the stage for potential use in several industries with an emphasis on survival.  The design in simple terms:  Born from the nanotechnology revolution, this invention leverages cost effective gold nanoparticles which are incorporated into surrounding objects. ÃÂÃÂ The gold nanoparticles are excitable via radiofrequency waves, which then generate heat. ÃÂÃÂ This device will allow you to cook while on the move, keep your body warm, and provide heat energy to your other tools. ÃÂÃÂ Throw in a built in GPS beacon system, high fidelity speakers, and intelligent API that connects to a smartphone and you've got the ultimate package. ÃÂÃÂ This device will be rechargeable via multiple mechanisms, including movement. ÃÂÃÂ In addition, this invention sets the stage for a green future, completely eliminating propane and flammable, toxic gases.

THE POTENTIAL OF THE INVENTION DETAILED  In present times, hikers, extended backpackers, touring cyclists, mountain climbers, trekking hunters, and other participants in outdoor activities are known to need a reliable, portable, safe source of on-demand heat. A source of heat provides comfort, protection from hypothermia, a means of purifying water and foodstuffs, and may be the single most important factor in the comfort or survival of an extended trip exposed to the elements. Fire has been the go-to source of heat and light since before antiquity; a universally useful asset to anyone hoping to brave the harsher conditions of the wilderness. However, fire may not be desirable in certain environments for fear of losing control of the fire or it may be impossible to start due to excessive dampness, or otherwise unattainable due to a lack of suitable fuel. In any of these scenarios, individuals may turn to chemical heater packs, gas-powered stoves, or electrical resistive coils. However, these all have notable drawbacks for an individual on the move. Chem-heaters are only active for a short time before completing their exothermic reaction and losing their potency. Gas-powered stoves require bulky, heavy cannisters to function (in addition to the base devices). Resistive coils are likewise difficult to use in a variety of situations; coils suitable for cooking are too hot for heating a body, and coils for a body too cool for cooking. So the need for a universal, effective, safe, portable source of heat remains.  The present invention relates to an apparatus capable of generating heat via the exposure of a resonant metallic suspension to radiofrequency irradiation. More specifically, the present invention utilizes this phenomenon to remotely generate heat within specifically constructed bodies outwardly similar to various existing unfulfilled, with users choosing an option that best fits their projected needs. In an adjacent field, an inventor named John S. Kanzius has pioneered an experimental method for treating cancer involving injecting a solution containing gold or carbon nanoparticles into a tumor, then exposing said solution (within the tumor) to radio waves. Given the low absorption rate of living tissues for radio- frequency energy, the waves may ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>targetÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ the metals for dielectric heating. This process has been observed to elicit an exothermic response from the solution; as the nanoparticles absorb the radio-frequency energy, they convert said energy to local thermal energy, heating the solution and any surrounding materials. It is hoped that this effect may be used to point-target malignant tissue for non-invasive radio-frequency radiation therapy. The present invention aims to harness the dialectic heating effect of radio waves on metallic nanoparticles to generate controllable, user-safe, highly variable heat with the use of a specific supporting structure. The present invention may be applied to a variety of existing assemblies, such as a knife, a cooking pot, a jacket, and other embodiments that may be realized by an individual skilled in the art of tool or clothing manufacture.ÃÂÃÂ          FIG 1 - Cooking Knife       FIG 2       FIG 3       FIG 4       FIG 5         FIG 6 - Backpacker Mini Stove       FIG 7       FIG 8       FIG 9        FIG 10 - Variably Controlled Warmth to Clothing       FIG 11       FIG 12       FIG 13       FIG 14        Risks and challenges  To produce a robust and portable radio frequency wave heat generator, funding in 3 Kickstarter phases with increasing rewards is needed for the following:  1) Materials 2) Patent attorneys  3) Engineering and scientific support 4) Machine shop/lab rental space 5) Marketing  To develop prototypes of the invention, fundraising will be established in several phases, with increasing financial demand.  Each phase will demonstrate progress and accomplishment.  Eventually, lab and machine shop space near a prominent university will be established;  particularly, California Institute of Technology near Pasadena.    Funding will follow the following Phases:  Phase 1 Fundraising: (current Kickstarter goal): Secure intellectual property and advertise. Phase 2 Fundraising:  Procure materials and recruit likeminded passionate engineers/scientists to allow the first prototype to come to fruition. Phase 3 Fundraising: Reserve lab/machine shop space to pilot prototypes into a larger scale production process.  Note: As this is Kickstarter Phase 1 of fundraising, money will only be used for intellectual property procurement and advertising.  There is no guarantee of a physical product as a result of Phase 1 and 2 fundraising.  Phase 3 will guarantee a free, tangible radio frequency wave generator to supporters who pledge for the reward specified at that time."

Stormwater is often overlooked but impacts everyone and everywhere. It is water from rain or snow fall that can soak into soil (infiltrate) or runoff into water bodies. Some runoff is natural, but too much, especially from impervious surfaces like parking lots and from increasingly intense rain events, can carry pollutants like litter, fertilizer, or exposed soil into nearby streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans. This diminishes water quality, sometimes to the point of impacting drinking water, and damages natural habitat.ÃÂÃÂ   Runoff can also cause erosion of streambanks, sloped areas, and exposed soil due to the power of the quickly moving water. This can result in degradation of stream bank stability and thus the natural stream processes and habitat, damage and destruction of infrastructure like bridges and pipes, and property loss and damage for landowners as well as a general decrease in aesthetics.ÃÂÃÂ   This is a problem faced around the country and around the world. A few recent examples include the California forest fires, the Hypoxic Zone in the Gulf of Mexico, and Iowa water quality issues. The links below can tell you more about each of these issues.ÃÂÃÂ    https://www.estormwater.com/runoff-treatment/storm-water-runoff-threatens-sacramento-river-watershed-post-carr-fire    https://www.epa.gov/ms-htf/hypoxia-101    https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/news/price-of-shrimp-affected-by-gulf-of-mexico-dead-zone/    https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/iowa-agriculture-runoff-water-pollution-environment/   In the pictures below you see stream bank erosion, undercutting, and loss of flow (because the channel is so much wider and there is less baseflow (water that feeds streams between rain events) from infiltration to feed the stream), algae growth (caused by excessive fertilizer in runoff), and erosion on a hillside. All of these were caused by increased runoff from increased impervious cover and more intense storms.ÃÂÃÂ      Stream bank erosion, undercutting, and loss of flow        Algae growth       Erosion on a hillside     So what is the project?   We have an agreement with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Division of State Parks to install two configurations of the patented stormwater management device we are developing in Rock Bridge Memorial State Park. The goal of the project is to further research, increase stormwater education in the park and around mid-Missouri, and address the negative impacts of excessive stormwater runoff in two areas of the park. This partnership between Infiltronics Environmental and Rock Bridge Memorial State Park will be beneficial to both parties and will further the development of this technology.We believe this device will change how people think about stormwater management and provide superior outcomes for the environment and those installing management methods such as developers and engineers. Because of the scale of these two installs including the labor, raw materials, and soil moisture sensors required, and the fact that we do not have an outside source of revenue, we need help funding this project to make it a reality.ÃÂÃÂ      Site 1       Site 2       Site 2       Site 1       Site 2     What is this device and how does it work? ÃÂÃÂ   This technology works to mimic natural stormwater processes by using redistribution (spreading water out) to increase infiltration. It is a patented technology and is comprised of geotextile fabric tubes with a variety of segments filled with different aggregate like gravel and sand. It is placed in shallow trenches (approximately 18ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ deep) around the site and then covered with the original top soil. The main innovation of the technology is three-dimensional flow. That is, vertical, longitudinal, and transverse (horizontal) flow. Changing the configuration and size of aggregate allows us to engineer how the concentrated water on a site moves through the soil. Each installation is site specific based on soil, slope, amount of rain in an area, and amount of impervious cover.ÃÂÃÂ      Patent Figure 1       Patent Figures 3 &amp; 4       Patent Figure 5A       Device Installation      What is Infiltronics Environmental and who are you?   Infiltronics Environmental is a company based in Columbia, MO that is developing a patented stormwater management device that works to undo the impacts of unmanaged or poorly managed stormwater runoff by mimicking natural processes of redistribution to increase infiltration. We want to provide efficient management solutions for engineers and developers while also improving environmental outcomes.ÃÂÃÂ   In the summer of 2017 we received a National Science Foundation I-Corps grant. The I-Corps program works with scientists and engineers to move out of the laboratory and into the real world with their technology. It helps teams understand all of the parts necessary to have a successful company and where they are on the path to becoming a successful company. A huge part of this is customer discovery work, going out and speaking to the people who will use it or be involved in the process of using it. The program gives each team $50,000, primarily for customer discovery. With these funds we spoke to almost 200 individuals in the stormwater industry around the country including engineers, developers, installers, and competing technology companies in California, Washington, New Jersey, Florida, Washington D.C., Texas, Illinois, and Missouri. From these interviews we learned about what is really needed in a solution and we are building this technology and our company around those needs, not just what we think is cool.ÃÂÃÂ   Before participating in the national I-Corps program we participated in the site program based out of Missouri S&amp;T. In this program we received $3,000 for customer discovery and prototype development. We used part of these funds for lab testing. In these lab tests we were able to show three-dimensional flow and continuation of flow from segment to segment. In the national I-Corps program a maximum of $5,000 of the grant could be used for prototype development. We used this portion of the grant to pay for part of our first field installation. We are currently collecting soil moisture data on the first field installation so we can provide quantitative evidence on how the device is redistributing and infiltrating concentrated runoff.ÃÂÃÂ   The team at Infiltronics Environmental is composed of Kathleen Trauth, Ph.D., P.E. and Virginia Trauth, E.I. Kathleen is an associate professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Missouri. She is a licensed professional engineer in Missouri and New Mexico and has over 30 years of engineering experience. Virginia has a degree in civil engineering from the University of Missouri and has earned her engineering intern certification from the State of Missouri, the first step towards licensure. She has engineering experience in the utility and civil engineering consulting industries as well as experience building and running research experiments. Oh yeah, and we are mother and daughter. See any resemblance?ÃÂÃÂ      Kathleen Trauth       Virginia Trauth     Check out this article on our acceptance into the I-Corps Program:ÃÂÃÂ    https://engineering.missouri.edu/2017/08/mu-mother-daughter-duo-receives-nsf-i-corps-support/   And these two on this project:   https://engineering.missouri.edu/2019/04/team-trauth-takes-big-step-toward-sustainable-stormwater-solution/ ÃÂÃÂ    https://www.columbiatribune.com/news/20190428/rock-bridge-state-park-tests-new-drain-system ÃÂÃÂ   At Infiltronics Environmental we have the mission to completely change and improve standard stormwater management by mimicking natural stormwater processes. At the end of the day we want to make the natural and built environments better and healthier places.   Why is this project important to you? ÃÂÃÂ   We are passionate about stormwater management because it impacts everyone and everywhere and because it is such an important resource but also has the potential for harm if not managed properly. We hate to see the negative impacts of poorly managed stormwater around the country and here in mid-Missouri and think we can help solve this problem.ÃÂÃÂ    How will you make this project happen?   To make this project a reality we will follow a blue-print similar to our first install but on a larger scale and with the added knowledge and experience from that install. We will use a soil scientist who is also a licensed onsite wastewater system designer to ensure that we understand the soil we are installing in. We will also use the services of a licensed septic installer to ensure that we have the minimal impact on the soil structure and the park as possible. The installer has extensive experience excavating on difficult terrain while maintaining necessary slopes and minimally impacting the site and soil structure. We will also use locally sourced aggregate and geotextile fabric intended and commonly used for permanent underground installation. The fabric has already been procured through a donation from Hanes Geo, a large supplier of geosynthetic and environmental products, whose parent company, Leggett &amp; Platt, is based out of Carthage, Missouri. We will use the same manufacturer of soil moisture sensors to collect our data and production of the units themselves has already begun to ensure that the installs can take place in a timely manner. As we mentioned above, we already have an agreement in place and have had our installation designs approved so we have a guaranteed location and approval to proceed. The only missing piece to make this project happen is the funding.   Why do we need your help?   We need your help because the scale of this project, financially, is a lot for a new two-person company without an existing source of revenue to handle. We have the team, expertise, site, technology, and plan in place to make this project a smashing success, but need your help to make it a reality. The $30,000 we are trying to raise is needed to cover raw materials, supplies, and labor for the installation. As a reminder, for a project to receive funds from Kickstarter, at a minimum the target goal must be met.   Rewards   Check out the sweet rewards you can get for donating to our campaign!

Active substance of DissOil ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>eats upÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ petroleum products, such asÃÂÃÂ oils and diesel. This process is called biodegradation and the rate,ÃÂÃÂ i.e. how fast DissOil eats up absorbed spills, is dependent on certainÃÂÃÂ factors. One is temperature and DissOil is active when the temperatureÃÂÃÂ is above freezing point. When below the active substance of DissOil is ÃÂÃÂ dormant. Absorption properties of DissOil still work for spills on snow ÃÂÃÂ and ice and the biodegradation will start again at temperatures aboveÃÂÃÂ freezing point..  Another factor that effects biodegradation rate is the texture of theÃÂÃÂ surface where a spill happens. The rate differs a bit between spills onÃÂÃÂ gravel, soil and water.  Third factor is moisture, i.e. access to water, which is theÃÂÃÂ accelerator for the process. This means that biodegradation rate isÃÂÃÂ fastest for spills on water.ÃÂÃÂ        For more results on how effective DissOil is, see  https://dissoil.com/how-effective/   DissOil has been tested by independent labs and has been evaluated by Skogforsk ÃÂÃÂ (The central research body for the Swedish forestry sector).

After forestry and construction markets we are aiming for markets like defence industry and offshore industry - both very large markets, the potential for DissOil is virtually unlimited. We truly have the chance to make a big difference for our precious nature!        TOMMY BLOM - WHY DISSOIL ÃÂÃÂ   I have worked all my professional life with wood supply to forest industry and power plants. All this activities is carbon dioxide neutral but still there are some negative impact on nature.ÃÂÃÂ   My driving force have been to reduce the negative effects by supporting processes and creating new harvesting methods and new techniques. One ongoing project is ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>On TrackÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ that we started some years ago. ItÃÂÃÂ´s a forestry machine that has rubber tracks instead of wheels and steel tracks. The idea is to reduce the damage to a minimum when the timber is transported out from the forest.ÃÂÃÂ   I think we all want to make a difference for the future with the effort and work we are doing every day. Now IÃÂÃÂ´m really happy and excited that we together, Johan, Jesper and I have developed an amazing product. I believe that DissOil will be a small revolution for all activities that have problem with oil spillage in the nature.ÃÂÃÂ   We are a small but hard working team with total different skills. Together with support from people that feel bad about oil spill in nature IÃÂÃÂ´m sure we will be successful with DissOil and that we together will reduce the negative effects from oil spills.ÃÂÃÂ     JOHAN DE FAIRE ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> WHY DISSOILÃÂÃÂ    Over a long carrier I have invented, discovered and been part of many exiting projects for the good of people and the environment ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> all based on naturally occurring phenomena. Enzymes from shrimp species for wound healing, proteins from mollusks for preservation of foodstuff and microbes for water purification are a few of my inventions. These are complicated mechanisms of action that cannot be seen by the naked eye, the results take long time to achieve and they are very hard to communicate in a laymanÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s way.ÃÂÃÂ   DissOil is the opposite ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> the actions are tangible and observable in minutes, the results are easy to measure and the product is basically self-explanatory ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> if there is an oil spill you spread DissOil over it. You cannot do wrong.ÃÂÃÂ   First generation DissOil is now ready for a market introduction and it will be a very thrilling journey as the responses from the field have been extremely positive. My wish is to be part of coming generations in the DissOil-family.ÃÂÃÂ     JESPER BLOM ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> WHY DISSOILÃÂÃÂ    For me personally DissOil is almost a too good to be true product. I have been working with product development for over 10 years and I have helped many other entrepreneurs to realize their products during these years and not once have I stumbled on a product this great!ÃÂÃÂ   DonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t get me wrong, there are many great products that I have been involved developing but all of these products have some sort of negative side. Function is great but the product is not environmentally friendly to produce. Or design of the product is great but the usability is not so good. This is normality and that is why I am so excited about DissOil ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> a product that is a win ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> win solution for everybody, both the environment but also for the companies responsible for oil spills.ÃÂÃÂ   DissOil has fantastic function, it helps clean up oil spills in nature, it is made from 100% organic products and it is carbon dioxide neutral ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> what more can you ask from a product! So that is why I work late nights and weekends trying to get DissOil on the market.ÃÂÃÂ        We need your help to fund a better package solution and a small production facility.ÃÂÃÂ    A better package solution   Today we just pack DissOil in a plastic bag and then seal it. This is very labour intense and the bag is not user friendly. We have conducted studies together with end users and the conclution is clear - Everyone wants a resealable bag.ÃÂÃÂ    Production facility   Today we produce DissOil 100% manually which means that we can only produce a small quantity and at a very high cost. The goal is to build a small production facility which is semi-automatic. This would result in high volume capacity (compared to today) and lower production costs. This would mean that our business model would work and that we can offer our customers DissOil at an affordable price!  In other words - without your help we have no way of getting DissOil out on the market, helping to save our nature from the harm of oil spills.      Risks and challenges  The greatest risk right now is that we need funding for a better package solution and funding for a small production facility. Without this we have no cost effective way of producing DissOil. We also donÃÂÃÂ´t have the capacity to produce DissOil in higher volumes."

ÃÂÃÂ Search engines will display dozens of images over a large number of antenna variations. ÃÂÃÂ These antennas have numerous applications which includes many areas of research. ÃÂÃÂ The one thing they all have in common is a pre-amp located right at the loop antenna terminals.   Applications and Other Uses    Atmospheric Phenomena    Lightning Detection and Triangulation    Volcanic Eruption Precursors    Seismic Precursors    Sensors    Security Systems    Bio-Hacking ÃÂÃÂ     Existing Amplifiers   The pre-amp is always some variation of low noise high gain voltage amplifier, Figure 1. ÃÂÃÂ There are even standard antenna SPICE models available to simulate their performance. ÃÂÃÂ The antenna SPICE models all assume a voltage driven voltage source. ÃÂÃÂ This model is inconsistent with data collected on some actual devices. ÃÂÃÂ Then I realized, the magnetic loop antenna is basically a current loop. ÃÂÃÂ So, we should be looking at a current to voltage amplifier or transimpedance amplifier, as they are called.     Figure 1: Low Noise High Gain Voltage Amplifier    I have been using this voltage amplifier, shown in Figure 1, for several years. ÃÂÃÂ I discovered problems with expected performance when using it on enhanced and miniaturized loop antennas. ÃÂÃÂ It became obvious that there is a discrepancy between actual output and realized output. ÃÂÃÂ This requires a different approach to modeling.     Figure 2: Transimpedance Amplifier    I simulated, built and tested the transimpedance amplifier, shown in Figure 2. ÃÂÃÂ There did not appear to be any output at all. ÃÂÃÂ Apparently, this problem may have been solved in some sensor applications. ÃÂÃÂ This may also be why no one has tried this before. ÃÂÃÂ There are no instances of transimpedance amplifiers on magnetic loop antennas that I know of.   Proposed Amplifier Development   I am proposing a research effort to determine the conditions of successful applications of transimpedance amplifiers used by other sensors and adapt the circuitry to magnetic loop antennas. ÃÂÃÂ The present antenna simulation model needs to be modified to reflect the current loop approach, which is inconsistent with a voltage loop approach. ÃÂÃÂ Then, I want to actually built up one unit and compare performance to the voltage amplifier shown in Figure 1. ÃÂÃÂ This requires time and resource expenditure. ÃÂÃÂ What I a need is a research grant to do this.   What you get   This is basically a research grant type project. ÃÂÃÂ The result is a document with a circuit diagram, real data, and an explanation of theory of operation. ÃÂÃÂ    Design and Engineering   The research time is rather short, since I already have some idea of where to look for related information. ÃÂÃÂ Once I see how similar problems were solved with other sensors, the design will be straight forward with the use of simulators. All of the equipment to build the prototype is already in place from the last project. ÃÂÃÂ Collecting data is the last step before writing the research paper. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ    Timeline   After the basic research phase, it will take some time to obtain semiconductors and parts to build up one experimental unit. ÃÂÃÂ Bread boarding it should not take more than a few days. ÃÂÃÂ Testing and any necessary modifications will take the most time. ÃÂÃÂ The time to write a final research and development paper is short in comparison. ÃÂÃÂ The entire project should take only 30 days from funding to completion.      Risks and challenges  I already have several scientific publications in professional journals, so I have professional experience doing this many times.  I have over 20 years of professional experience designing new products and taking them to market.  Many examples of this can be found on my website.  Whether or not the transimpedance amplifier will work with a current loop magnetic antenna will be determined by experiment.  From that point of view, there is no risk.  There is only data as to whether or not it works and what is necessary to make it work."

My name is Michael DeMaria and I am born and raised in NYC. I am currently a college student at Pace University graduating this May. With the stress of studying and internships over the past four years of college, without going out and having fun on the weekends, I would not have made it this far. Living in NYC my whole life, I have spent countless weekends traveling all over the City to find the perfect bars for my friends and I. ÃÂÃÂ To this day, I still find myself on the weekends barhopping from LES to the Meatpacking to FIDI to Midtown spending countless amounts of money on cabs and I am TIRED OF IT. If you're like me, you were probably stressed out all week, why not spend your weekend right.   ""I always go out to one bar thinking there's going to be people there, and I end up having to take a cab to the other side of the city.""  - NightOut allows you to see which bars/areas are heating up!   ""I want to play beer pong tonight""  - NightOut can filter out bars with specific activities!   ""I'm planning on hitting a club for my friends birthday this weekend, but I can't find a promoter!"" -  NightOut has a list of promoters for each specific club!  All of these problems ÃÂÃÂ are solved with my new project ""NightOut.""ÃÂÃÂ Many people I know that aren't from the city are always texting me and other friends about where to go. This app will solve all of those issues.ÃÂÃÂ   This is going to be an application on the phone that has a map of NYC (and major cities/college towns) and names of bars that are going to be on the app. When someone goes on the app they can see who checked in to what bars (friends or anonymous) and also when the user zooms out they can see which areas (Saint mark's, LES, Meatpacking) are ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>heating upÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ and where the people are. Some Bars will have drink deals when you check in at their bar. You can also see when pressing on each bar what they have on different days (1 dollar beers on monday) or you can filter the bar into other things like beer pong, darts, pool. Under each bar you click it will also tell you all of the details of that bar/club including dress codes, types of liquors, and more! The app will also have a specific tab for going clubbing! You can quickly link up with some of the best promoters in NYC for a night out!      Risks and challenges  I do not expect any risks with the development of this app. The only risk I can possibly see is if not enough people use it, which I will make sure does not happen. Living in NYC my whole life and going out every weekend has led me to meet many people including bar owners, promoters, and bartenders at bars across the city!"

Risks and challenges  There are no particular risks, or at least we don't foresee any particular risks when it comes to fulfilling our backers rewards. We've built our prototype, our custom OS, we have carefully researched sources for materials and components.  The only small thing we can think of is not being able to get enough ARM SoC boards in time from our suppliers, thus shipping of consoles could be delayed slightly. All other parts are readily available and are not a problem to get high quantities at any time. The I/O shield and SoC-mounting frames and the case for IndieGo XS are done by us directly in the workshop."

Nicht meckern sondern MACHEN     (Erstellt mit https://www.shirtinator.de/)    Fast jeder findet die Proteste der SchÃÂÃÂ¼ler gegen die Tatenlosigkeit im Klimaschutz gut, nur was tust  DU  dagegen?ÃÂÃÂ   Der Verzicht auf die Currywurst oder das Auto alleine hilft nicht mehr viel. Einen Baum zu pflanzen wÃÂÃÂ¤re ein sehr guter Anfang, aber im selben Moment werden weltweit tausende BÃÂÃÂ¤ume gefÃÂÃÂ¤llt.   Wenn WIR wirklich etwas erreichen wollen, mÃÂÃÂ¼ssen wir schon ein paar hundert Millionen Hektar WÃÂÃÂ¼ste in den nÃÂÃÂ¤chsten 5 Jahren begrÃÂÃÂ¼nen.  Mit IrrigationNets ist das nicht nur mÃÂÃÂ¶glich, sondern Investoren kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen damit sogar noch Geld verdienen. Denn nur durch einen wirtschaftlichen Ansatz kann eine LÃÂÃÂ¶sung auch in der Breite umgesetzt werden und somit etwas bewirken.ÃÂÃÂ    IrrigationNets   Unsere LÃÂÃÂ¶sung zur WÃÂÃÂ¼stenbegrÃÂÃÂ¼nung ist ganz einfach. Anstatt Meerwasser sehr aufwÃÂÃÂ¤ndig und teuer zu entsalzen, lassen wir dieses nur in sehr groÃÂ<U+009F>en Mengen salzfrei verdunsten.                            Mit der KÃÂÃÂ¼hlung fÃÂÃÂ¼r ein 10 MW PV-Kraftwerk verdunsten wir tÃÂÃÂ¤glich 4 Millionen Liter Meerwasser und produzieren 270 Millionen Kubikmeter kalter feuchter Luft. Das Trinkwasser holen sich dann die Pflanzen aus der Luft. Das geschieht auf einer sehr groÃÂ<U+009F>en FlÃÂÃÂ¤che von mehreren tausend Hektar. Das nennt man dann auch Morgentau und dieser natÃÂÃÂ¼rliche Prozess ist eine sehr effektive und kostenlose Form der MikrobewÃÂÃÂ¤sserung fÃÂÃÂ¼r jeden einzelnen Grashalm.ÃÂÃÂ      Potential in der Weidewirtschaft    Das bei der Verdunstung entstehende Salz kann aufgefangen und als Streusalz verkauft werden. Das Salz bleibt nicht in den Netzen hÃÂÃÂ¤ngen, sondern wird immer ausgespÃÂÃÂ¼lt und unter den Netzen gesammelt. Auch absichtlich stark versalzene und mehrfach getrocknete Netze konnten selbst mit ÃÂÃÂ¼bersÃÂÃÂ¤ttigter SalzlÃÂÃÂ¶sung komplett ausgespÃÂÃÂ¼lt werden.     Absichtlich versalzene Netze    /  Wieder vollstÃÂÃÂ¤ndig ausgewaschene Netze    Hier noch ein weiteres Video, welches die Funktionsweise von IrrigationNets erklÃÂÃÂ¤rt. In unseren sehr kostengÃÂÃÂ¼nstigen Netzen hÃÂÃÂ¤ngen Millionen kleiner und kleinster Wassertropfen bei geringem Windwiderstand in der Luft. Diese kleinen Tropfen haben eine geringe Masse, aber dafÃÂÃÂ¼r eine sehr groÃÂ<U+009F>e OberflÃÂÃÂ¤che, woraus eine sehr hohe Verdunstungsrate resultiert. Da die Tropfen nicht zerspringen, sondern nur langsam an den Netzen entlanglaufen, werden kaum SalzmolekÃÂÃÂ¼le an die Luft abgegeben und wir haben eine salzfreie OberflÃÂÃÂ¤chenverdunstung. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ                             Wir produzieren mit IrrigationNets also nur sehr groÃÂ<U+009F>e Mengen kalter salzfreier feuchter Luft. Mit dieser Luft kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen wir im ersten Schritt berÃÂÃÂ¼hrungsfrei Solarkraftwerke kÃÂÃÂ¼hlen, die dadurch bis zu 20% mehr Strom produzieren. Das ist weit mehr  zusÃÂÃÂ¤tzliche  Energie als wir fÃÂÃÂ¼r den Betrieb von IrrigationNets benÃÂÃÂ¶tigen. Das Kraftwerk verkauft somit normal seinen Strom und ist eine klassische, berechenbare und vor allem finanzierbare Investition mit kostenlosen zusÃÂÃÂ¤tzlichen Nutzen fÃÂÃÂ¼r die Umwelt.  Im zweiten Schritt kÃÂÃÂ¼hlen und befeuchten wir die umliegende Landwirtschaft im Umkreis von 5 km, wodurch hier ca. 30% mehr Ertrag erziehlt werden kann.ÃÂÃÂ      Salzfreie SolarkÃÂÃÂ¼hlung + Agrarbefeuchtung mit Meerwasser    Im dritten Schritt versorgen wir die umliegenden DÃÂÃÂ¼rregebiete im Umkreis von 100 km mit hÃÂÃÂ¶heren Mengen an Morgentau. (Bei schwachen Wind der StÃÂÃÂ¤rke 2 = 11 km/h sogar bis zu 250 km am Tag). Dabei wird natÃÂÃÂ¼rlich nicht jedes Gebiet jeden Tag versorgt. Je nach Windrichtung geht die Feuchtigkeit mal in die eine und mal in die andere Richtung. Das ist jedoch ein groÃÂ<U+009F>er Vorteil, denn Pflanzen kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen sehr gut eine Trockenphase ÃÂÃÂ¼berstehen. Bei drei Monaten DÃÂÃÂ¼rre am StÃÂÃÂ¼ck sieht das natÃÂÃÂ¼rlich anders aus. Wenn aber nur an 10 von 30 Tagen geringere Temperaturen, eine hÃÂÃÂ¶here Luftfeuchtigkeit und grÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂ<U+009F>ere Mengen an Morgentau auftreten, dann kann sich die Natur unter diesen Bedingungen sehr viel besser entwickeln.ÃÂÃÂ      Statistische Wasserverteilung    Versuche im Trockenfeldbau zeigen deutlich, dass schon geringe Unterschiede in der Versorgung sehr groÃÂ<U+009F>e Unterschiede in der Entwicklung ausmachen kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen. Mit IrrigationNets kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen wir somit auf sehr groÃÂ<U+009F>en Gebieten eine ganz neue Form des Trockenfeldbaus ermÃÂÃÂ¶glichen. Bei unserm ""UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzten Trockenfeldbau"" ÃÂÃÂ¤ndern wir das Mikroklima durch die kalte feuchte Luft in der Region. Das alles ohne Betriebskosten oder teure GewÃÂÃÂ¤chshÃÂÃÂ¤user!     Geringe Unterschiede in der Feuchtigkeit haben groÃÂ<U+009F>e Auswirkungen auf die Entwicklung    Doch damit es so weit kommt, brauchen wir auch  DEINE UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzung  bei der Produktentwicklung und der MarkterschlieÃÂ<U+009F>ung. Denn auch mit unseren zwei ersten funktionierenden Prototypen in Berlin konnten wir noch keine Investoren oder Kunden ÃÂÃÂ¼berzeugen. Jeder mÃÂÃÂ¶chte gerne das fertige Produkt + 10 Jahre Langzeiterfahrung sehen, aber niemand traut sich, der erste Kunde zu sein.ÃÂÃÂ      Die ersten zwei Prototypen von IrrigationNets                              ÃÂÃÂ Aus diesem Grund bauen wir jetzt eine erste verkaufsfÃÂÃÂ¤hige Anlage in Kaisersesch (Rheinland-Pfalz) bei einem Solarkraftwerk auf.ÃÂÃÂ    Pimp your plant   Die VerdunstungskÃÂÃÂ¼hlung von IrrigationNets ist hoch effektiv und sehr kostengÃÂÃÂ¼nstig und kann deswegen sehr groÃÂ<U+009F> skaliert werden. Dadurch kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen wir sehr groÃÂ<U+009F>e Mengen an kalter Luft bereitstellen, um Solarkraftwerke zu kÃÂÃÂ¼hlen. Nun ist zwar bis zu 20% mehr Stromertrag schon eine echte Hausnummer, aber die Investoren sind harte Rechner und erwarten noch grÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂ<U+009F>ere Renditen. Aus diesem Grunde bieten wir die Aufwertung von alten Kraftwerken an. Denn bei einem alten Solarkraftwerk mit alter EinspeisevergÃÂÃÂ¼tung ist jede kWh bis zu drei Mal so viel Wert wie bei heutigen Projekten, da die EinspeisevergÃÂÃÂ¼tungen extrem gesunken sind.     Links KÃÂÃÂ¼hlanlagen incl. Eigenstromversorgung, rechts altes Solarkraftwerk mit hoher EinspeisevergÃÂÃÂ¼tung    Unter jedem Giebel werden 1.200 Quadratmeter Verdunsternetze angebracht, in denen ca. 5 Millionen Mikrotropfen bei geringem Windwiderstand in der Luft hÃÂÃÂ¤ngen. Hier die Planung und das bereits vorhandene Material fÃÂÃÂ¼r den ersten Giebel:     Giebel: Abmessungen und Material    Die Netze haben wir bereits vormontiert. Dadurch kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen die Netze auf der Baustelle dann in kurzer Zeit an 4 Aluminiumprofilen unter der Alu-Konstruktion aufgehÃÂÃÂ¤ngt werden. ÃÂÃÂ Die Holzkonstruktion diente dabei nur als Montagehilfe.     Vormontage der Netze / erste HÃÂÃÂ¤lfte = 600 m2       Beginn der Bauarbeiten        Fundamente fÃÂÃÂ¼r die Anlage von 6,6m * 6m * 2,5m       Weiterer Baufortschritt nach verletzungsbedinger 2 wÃÂÃÂ¶chiger Pause       ... und das Wetter fÃÂÃÂ¤llt uns in den RÃÂÃÂ¼cken. Wir hatten dort schon kurzÃÂÃÂ¤rmlig gearbeitet.    Aktuelles Update vom 01.05.2019:     Leider hatten nicht alle Helfer Zeit, daher war kein weiterer Aufbau mÃÂÃÂ¶glich       VerstÃÂÃÂ¤rkung der Fundamente     Inzwischen bauen wir die erste verkaufsfÃÂÃÂ¤hige Version auf, nur sind uns die Kosten etwas explodiert. FÃÂÃÂ¼r die wetterbedingten hÃÂÃÂ¶heren Baukosten, letzten technischen Verbesserungen, online ÃÂ<U+009C>berwachung und Steuerung sowie zugehÃÂÃÂ¶rige wissenschaftliche Untersuchung und Evaluation benÃÂÃÂ¶tigen wir weitere 17.000 Euro. ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂ<U+009C>ber das 70% Zuschuss Programm TransferBonus kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen wir damit ein Entwicklungsprojekt ÃÂÃÂ¼ber 45.000 Euro finanzieren.  Eine erste kleine Anlage in Marokko schlÃÂÃÂ¤gt dann noch einmal mit weiteren 12.000 Euro zu Buche.  Bei sehr groÃÂ<U+009F>er UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzung wird auch eine grÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂ<U+009F>ere Anlage in Spanien fÃÂÃÂ¼r weitere 60.000 Euro mÃÂÃÂ¶glich. Die Anlage in Spanien ersetzt dann schon einen kleinen Regenwald, zumindest was die KÃÂÃÂ¼hlung und Befeuchtung der umgebenden Steppe betrifft.  Mit diesen Referenzen sollten dann auch endlich Kunden und weitere Investoren gewonnen werden kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen.  Das Potential fÃÂÃÂ¼r diese LÃÂÃÂ¶sung liegt bei ÃÂÃÂ¼ber 10.000 Solarkraftwerken im Megawattbereich. Diese kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen an Standorten auf einer KÃÂÃÂ¼stenlinie von ÃÂÃÂ¼ber ÃÂÃÂ 200.000 km in ÃÂÃÂ¼ber 40 dÃÂÃÂ¼rregeplagten LÃÂÃÂ¤ndern stehen. Zudem finden sich im Norden Kenias, der algerischen WÃÂÃÂ¼ste, Jordanien, Paraguay und Chile sehr groÃÂ<U+009F>e Mengen an versalzenem Grundwasser im Landesinneren.  Sobald sich diese Technik durchsetzt, werden diese wirtschaftlicheren Solarkraftwerke nebenbei die umgebenden DÃÂÃÂ¼rregebiete renaturieren und DÃÂÃÂ¼rren bekÃÂÃÂ¤mpfen und somit den Klimawandel bremsen.   Damit wir das leisten kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen, brauchen wir jetzt bei der MarkteinfÃÂÃÂ¼hrung Eure UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzung. Denn ohne Referenzen im Ausland gibt es keine Kunden und keine Verbreitung.

ALMOST TWICE THE TORQUE OUTPUT OF THE BICYCLE IN THE VIDEO ABOVE.     Pulley Wheel Machines   as well as   Lever Machines   are ancient and have been used to decrease effort for thousands of years, when lifting extremely heavy objects. Below are some images of the currently filed design with the USPTO. This bicycle is evolving, so the final product may look more streamline than the concept you are looking at. We care about this project because it have believe it would improve the human condition and of course we like mind blowing technology you can use every day.                 ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ In fact, we are so confident of this bicycle's performance, we would be willing to set aÃÂÃÂ  Guinness World Record  of the lightest human powered bicycle with the most torque per range.ÃÂÃÂ        I intend to use the funds to pay for a ÃÂÃÂ Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent application. The reason why I think this is important is because this bicycle is design is a universal machine that is beneficial to all Humans and will make the Human condition easier. Furthermore, a ÃÂÃÂ PCT application would open more doors to revenue generation and increase the value of the patent application already filed with the USPTO. Here are the benefits this bicycle would provide:  1. Green transportation, which does not harm the environment.  2. It promotes exercise, which is healthy for individuals, community and society.  3. A healthier community reduces the financial toll on America's healthcare system.  4. The building of these bicycles creates jobs and economic opportunity.  ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ a. Bike sharing companies could be formed creating more administrative jobs, as well as ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ technical service jobs when it comes to bicycle maintenance and repair.

Building these bicycles in America would give the US industrial machine the lead in thisÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ particular technology and an advantage over foreign competition in bicycle technology.  7. The Pulley Wheel Machine bicycle would get the youth interested in math, engineeringÃÂÃÂ   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ as well as the physical sciences and make this field fun!  My name is Rashad Scarborough. I was born in Newark, NJ and raised in North Carolina. I have been developing this technology for 14 years and getting close to perfection in bicycle performance. The book, entitled: The Science behind Superior Performance Bicycles, would explain how two force multiplying machines combined (Pulley wheel and Lever machine) would amplify torque output, while maintaining significant amount of range useful to all humans worldwide. This machine is a useful tool for aiding humans in the journey of life. I founded the company call Precisia Bikes LLC. A company that specializes in lever propelled bicycles.  PRECISIA BIKES IS PROBABLY THE MOST ADVANCED IN LEVER PROPELLED BICYCLES AND HERE IS WHY. CHECK OUT HOW THE COMPANY EVOLVED THIS NICHE.       2011 Original P       2014 P Classic       2018 HTC       2019 SPB       1. Scientifically proven to have more torque per range than  any  conventional bicycle.  2. Gravitational advantage, force vector advantage and mechanical advantage, especially at the peak of the bicycleÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s pedal stroke.  3. More powerful and consistent angular force vectors from the peak of the pedal movement to the base of the pedal movement. Therefore, there is less fluctuation in force needed to pedal this bicycle.  4. Hollow lever machine structure that canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t be bent by human weight, because the steel cable reinforcement from the outside harnesses the whole tubular structure of the lever machine instead at just on point on the lever machine.  5. Hollow lever machine tubes makes this bicycle conventional light and lighter than some conventional bicycles on the market.  6. Multispeed hub on the bicycle makes it easy to shift gears while moving and standing still.  7. Low top tube makes this bicycle easy to mount for women and men, while being consistent with bike sharing frame designs.  8. The bicycleÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s design is very simple and pleasing to look at.  9. Propelled by DyneemahÃÂÃÂ® rope, which is stronger than steel cable yet 8 times lighter than steel cable.  10. Easier to climb hills on the Wraparound ÃÂ¢<U+0084>ÃÂ¢ bicycle, because one could take advantage of gravity and oneÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s weight at the pedaling peak instead of just leg muscles at the pedaling peak like conventional bicycles.  11. Hollow lever tubes make it easy to store batteries in this bicycle, if you wanted to convert this bicycle into an E-bike. The batteries donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t stick out like an eye sore and you would not know if the bicycle was electronically powered.  12. Low friction dry steel, non-sealed bearings reduces friction and increases torque.  13. Lower longer stirring cylinder leaves space for a promotional pendant flag to bear promotional trademarks, while this flag can double for a pouch for carrying pocket items.  14. Optional rear disk brakes are available with applicable multispeed hubs.  15. Easy to manufacture, because most components are already manufactured. Only the frame, lever machines and radial drive cylinder mechanisms are unique.  16. This frame can be built from aluminum, chromoly or carbon fiber tubes be to lighter.  17. Can easily be rented in bike sharing programs.  18. Extra fail safety feature include steel cable along sided DyneemahÃÂÃÂ® rope so pedals never hit the ground.  19.

Thus, it would be very sustainable to deliver an E-book so that potential buyers of the product would understand the nature of the bicycle , how to maintain it and what to expect from it.""  Here are some pages of the E-book describing how we determined how the SPB has more torque per range than conventional bicycles:   1. Torque test and proof of superior torque. How less vector force resistance results in superior performance  Three tube bending dies were tied together on a plastic rope and looped around the pedal of conventional bicycle while the pedals were at an 180 degree turn (approx.).       Then a tube taped to the handle bars was pressed up against a digital scale when the pull of the weights pushed the bicycle forward. The Red tube bending machines props the bicycle up with the plastic rope in order to get accurate scale readings.       The scale reads 3 lbs and 10.6 oz of forward pressure.  The same experiment was conducted on the SPB using the same weight.            The same tube was taped to the handle bar of the SPB and pressed up against the digital scale when the weight on the pedal pushed the bicycle forward.  The digital scale yielded 6 lbs and 11.2 oz. Almost twice as much as than a conventional bicycle using the same weight. Thus this bicycle cranks out almost twice as much horse power than a conventional bicycle when the pedal movement to rear wheel movement ratios are matched.          This demonstration was necessary to illustrate how both bicycles can be tested, if you have a SPB in your possession and wish to try this experiment on your own to verify the results.

I always have a hard time collecting my purse, gripping my phone, and dealing with my luggage on airports. You know what? There are actually suitcases that followÃÂÃÂ you around like a puppy and the Cowarobot R1 is one of them.    The Cowarobot is a carry-on sized robot suitcase that stays with you all the time. It moves by itself, so you can drink your coffee and talk on the phone while you walk around. It's smart enough to avoid obstacles and it may lag a bit if it does, but it will always find its way to you and catch up with you.    This nifty robot is a loyal little travel companion that can hit speeds up to 4.5 mph and can take on slopes at a 15-degree inclination. Security is not an issue either. Aside from GPS tracking feature, the bag has a CO-SMART intelligent lock that your R1 bracelet can unlock. The bracelet, byÃÂÃÂ the way, also serves as a keyless remote for you to control the bag.  Best Features:    Robotic suitcase that follows you around    Runs up to 4.5 mph and can cover 12.5 miles at full charge    Portable powerbank that charges your iPhone 6s Plus 9 times    Complies with airport regulations       Risks and challenges  This product is safe to use and fail safe mechanisms are designed into the product to guarantee safety and customer satisfaction. So the blue rope in the 2019 version of the Wraparound is made out of Dyneema rope. This rope is 8 times lighter than steel, but stronger than steel.  Its breaking point is 7,700 lbs, so not human weight can break this rope. Other safety features would include a steel fail safe cable that would flex along side the Dyneema rope as a backup in order to keep the rider safe. The steel cable's maximum operating load would be 640 lbs. Maximum human weight on the bicycle would 300 lbs, so this steel cable structure could not be broken by human weight, even though there would not be sustained pressure on the looped steel cable. Other safety features would include a steel bent wire over each rail that would guard the dyneema rope from jumping off of a radial drive cylinder. The frame of the bicycle has been welded by HLS Precision Welding. The individual welder of the bicycle Mr. Howard is very skilled and professional of critical welds. So riders can rest assured that these frames won't break. The company Precisia Bikes LLC currently uses Shamano Nexus 7 speed hub to give riders options to change gears when pedaling this bicycle. These hubs are rugged and have a know reputation for long lasting quality. The bow and arrow looking lever machines look scary, but they are the safest and lightest lever machines on a bicycle for forward propulsion that you will find. That is because the steel cable over the aluminum tube has a breaking point of 5480 lbs. No human weight can break this steel cable. The reason why this cable is position like this is because it increases the strength of the aluminum tube 10 times. If this tube was supported by a steel cable from a point along the aluminum tube that lever machine would be less safe and heavier. That is because the load point at that tube would by subject to bending at that point, even if it were reinforced from the inside of the tube with metal. So when a steel cable is suspended from the ends of the tube and then suspended from that cable the whole tubular structure of the tube is harnessed thus make it human load impossible to bend the tube, because the force of the steel cable is pointing horizontally and not vertically like older models. Thus, it is easier to bend a tube at a point, than to crush a tube from on end to the other end. There are two types of shock absorbents for the riders joints. Each lever machine has a rubber disk about 3/8"" thick. So when a lever machine makes contact with the frame of the bike, the rubber absorbs the shock. Furthermore, it's opposite adjacent lever machine steel cable stretches slightly to provide a spring like absorption.  The main risk is that the financial goals would not be met."

We cannot control the factory, the raw material production, nor the weather that affects when their workers arrive. We don't anticipate any setbacks, but we also canÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t predict the future. Not yet.  DELIVERY, SHIPPING, CUSTOMS AND DUTIES INFORMATION  One challenge will be the shipping freight, because this is out of our control.  We'll have backers from all over the world and in order to avoid logistic problems, we will ship all orders from our manufacturing location in China.  Our prices do not include VAT, GST or other taxes but we can mark the package as gift or commercial samples for companies. In most countries, you will not need to pay any taxes when marked as gift or sample, but we advise you to check with your local authorities. In general, parcels under $ 100 are exempt from taxes.  As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Kickstarter.  If our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and you don't receive it because youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re not there, it's the wrong address, moved without notifying us, the package returns back to China and you will have to pay for shipping both ways if you want us to re-send your product.  When you receive your tracking #, please keep an eye out for the package.  COMMUNICATION CHALLENGES  We was surprised at the number of backers that DO NOT complete their surveys and supply an address for delivery. If you want your awesome swag in a timely manner, PLEASE do yourself a favor and provide a REAL email address that you use frequently.  Many backers used an email address that they donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t check very often, probably because they wanted to avoid unnecessary spam. However weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re not spamming you. PLEASE make sure you read our messages and emails in a timely manner. We plan on communicating weekly via campaign updates, so check your email, and youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ll be in the loop!  Campaign updates will be the primary way we communicate with you. Please donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t rely VizyÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook Community or email newsletters. We wonÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t share updates about the campaign on those platforms!  We can promise a pretty smooth experience if you stay abreast of shipping requirements and project updates throughout the campaign lifecycle.  No matter what obstacles lie ahead we promise you that we will be 100% transparent in our communication with you. We want the best and we know you do too!"

Why WROOM the Truck is so special??!  I began to think for a solution to include wireless charging in toys, after my 2 year old nephew swallowed a battery from one of his toys. i did some researches and noticed there are thousands of children around the world with battery ingestion reported annually. So, i made WROOM the Truck with wireless charging capacity and a sealed battery. This way children will be safe and the cost for the AA batteries is gone.ÃÂÃÂ    Why wireless charging is better than buying normal batteries?ÃÂÃÂ   In the chart below you can see that 1 kWh of energy in AA batteries cost's 233.92 GBP, because a battery can provide only 4.1 Wh of energy, this means you will need 244 batteries to produce 1 kWh electricity.ÃÂÃÂ        Today many products sold with batteries included, use low grade, low energy carbon type batteries as a marketing ploy. These batteries will often perform poorly and need to be replaced promptly. It is not uncommon for the manufacturers to install the very type of battery they recommend against!

What if you could do this in a non-invasive way, sending and receiving only the information you absolutely need, without getting caught up in the web of social media? What if you could  spend less time staring into your phone and more time embracing life,  while still resting assured that you are connected to all the messages that are important to you? Now you can. The answer is  inform8r .ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ    The  UsersÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>  Solution    inform8r  is an entirely new type of messaging app, one that is aimed at organizers, managers, and anyone who has to reach out to a specific group of people to provide them with information. This app never asks for or retains your personal information. It is a pure way to communicate with exactly the people you want to communicate with, with none of the clutter. Clean communication, clean messaging, that's what inform8r is all about. ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ   A cleaner, more streamlined alternative to messaging apps like Viber, WhatsApp and Messenger    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ With inform8r, there are no group replies and no comments. It is just a clean messaging system. It is more powerful and useful for organizers and managers than other apps, like Viber and WhatsApp. It is quick and easy to make groups of any size, with all members ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>BCCed,ÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ for privacy and functionality. It is a one-way messaging system in which the manager can send out necessary messages in a clean manner. ÃÂÃÂ This sounds cool, but ... ÃÂÃÂ    How does it work?   Find out here ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ The App lets you write and edit your message in a few simple steps, create and segment your audience according to your needs, sort your audience into groups for a more targeted distribution, create one message and distribute it repeatedly, get feedback on your message instantlyÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ A group organizer invites members via their emails or MMS by scanning a QR code. The organizer can then send out messages to all group members. Only the organizer (and other group members he can allow to send out messages) can see who is in the group. This guarantees privacy. ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ Group members receive these messages instantly but can only respond directly to the group organizer(like replying to an event). This eliminates the often annoying frequency of messages pinging into your phone when a group of thirty friends keep messaging and everyone in the group receives every message, even if the content is not intended for all. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s the  crucial difference between inform8r and existing messaging apps,  which are perfectly good (like Viber, Whatsapp and Messenger) but different and not quite as good at what inform8r can do.  ÃÂÃÂ      A group organizer invites members via their emails or MMS by scanning a QR code. You can share a groupÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s QR code or groupÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s content to social media or simply make the group public, so it can be found inside the app.    ÃÂÃÂ  Features ÃÂÃÂ    What makes inform8r unique?        ÃÂÃÂ   A word from the inventor ÃÂÃÂ         Hi, my name is Kristjan Marin, and I am the founder and inventor of inform8r. A few years ago, I realized that I was spending far too much time on social media. While I still enjoy using it, I felt like it was taking over my life and I was growing too reliant on it, looking at my phone more than I was living life. I wanted to come up with some sort of solution that would provide the benefits of being in touch with the people I need to be in touch with, but that felt less invasive into my engagement with the real world. That's when I came up with inform8r.   Man has invented languages and media channels to share thoughts and communicate ideas. The world today, however, is cluttered with messages and to find relevant information and be heard is not an easy task. No matter what you do for a living, whether you are an entrepreneur, an artist or a teacher, there is always some relevant audience out there with which you would like to communicate. If you need to say something to one person or are in the same physical location as your audience (at an office, for instance), then there is no problem. But if you are trying to reach hundreds or thousands of people who would like to hear from you, well, that is a completely different story.     Every significant discovery in human history has been made with a solution to a certain problem in mind. I have many interests and I've used many Social Media platforms ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0094> itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s always frustrating to have to browse through numerous selfies and food pictures when you would just like to see if your favorite brand has something new for you. If IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m a fan of a certain product or service, I want to be spoken to directly and without being forced to jump through hoops for them. And if I have something important to share with my clients, I wouldnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t like to send them messages one by one and waste time that could be spent improving solutions IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m working on with them. And thatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s exactly what we are trying to achieve with the    inform8r   .  ÃÂÃÂ    Why we need your helpÃÂÃÂ     ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s important to me that inform8r be free of charge . I didnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t design it to make money, but with a genuine desire to help free people from their smartphones, while letting them still feel connected with whatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s important. IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve invested my last four years in this project, with thousands of hours of time and energy, not to mention a whole lot of my own money. IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>d  like to keep inform8r free , but I need some help to do so. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m turning to you, to ask for your support.   ÃÂÃÂ  Ways inform8r can be used ÃÂÃÂ   Imagine that your children's field trip at school will result in pickup delayed by two hours. With a touch of a button, the teacher can let all the parents know and be 100% certain that the messages will be received. Imagine a business manager who needs to communicate with all the people in his department, quickly and with certainty. How about a soccer teamÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s coach who needs to cancel practice and wants to get the message out to all 25 team members? Or on a bigger scale, imagine a marketing department manager for a multinational company who wants to send a promotional message or coupon to several thousand interested clients, but wants to do so in a discreet way that will not get lost in the tidal wave of information that overwhelms us in social media apps?ÃÂÃÂ          inform8r  is perfect for sending out instant messages to groups that you are organizing. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s great for   ÃÂÃÂ small businesses who wish to inform their customers ÃÂÃÂ     teachers who wish to inform parents of their students ÃÂÃÂ     coaches who wish to inform their team members ÃÂÃÂ     event organizers who wish to inform their audiences ÃÂÃÂ     marketing directors or publicists who wish to inform the media or customers    business centers who wish to inform their clients or tenants    fitness instructors who wish to inform their participants    business owners and CEOS who wish to inform their staff    chefs who wish to place orders on produce and ingredients    food trucks which wish to inform fans of a 2-for-1 deal on hot dogs    and so much more!ÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ  inform8r  can do all this and more, more cleanly, efficiently, privately and easily than existing messaging apps.   ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ Wait, this is so cool,  why is it free?ÃÂÃÂ  ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s important to the inventor, Kristjan, that inform8r is free to all. But in order to make it free and keep it free, we need a little help from you. ÃÂÃÂ   See how all began in 2014 ...        Tech SpecsÃÂÃÂ    inform8r is already available in a beta version on  AppStore  &amp; Google Play and has been thoroughly tested for both Android and Apple smartphones. A desktop version, geared towards mass messaging for businesses and marketing, is a future goal. The app works beautifully, so weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re about 90% there, nearly ready for prime-time! ÃÂÃÂ    We Need Your Help   WeÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re 90% there, but we need a little help to make inform8r a reality thatÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦and this is the most important partÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ¦ will be free for everyone . At the moment, we put so much time and personal finance into developing the app, that we would need to charge for it in order to climb out of the red and to get our credit cards out of hock.    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ We need a bit of capital to get back into the black and that will allow us to make inform8r free for all. ThatÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s why weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re asking for your help.  ÃÂÃÂ   What Do You Get ÃÂÃÂ   In exchange for backing a worthy project, you get to be the first in the world with this amazing app. You will also get additional benefits that will never be available after the Kickstarter campaign.       ÃÂÃÂ   Planned timeline ÃÂÃÂ        Case study  In order to test how  inform8r  works in practice, we prepared a case study in Maribor, the second-largest city in Slovenia (population around 100,000).  Inform8r  is at its best when a concentration of people and businesses put this new, free group messaging app to work.ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ The case study included a large percentage of MariborÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s population, including:   ÃÂÃÂ  FC Maribor  (football club with 20,000 fans)    ÃÂÃÂ  BMW Selmar  (with 10,000 customers)    ÃÂÃÂ  The Pohorje Region Tourist board , which welcomes more than 180,000 tourists per year    ÃÂÃÂ  Cultural centre Narodni dom Maribor  (over 2220 events &amp; 380.000 visitors per year)    Two major  political groups  have showen interest(with more then 30,000 members) ÃÂÃÂ    In addition to this large constituency, other groups included:   ÃÂÃÂ  Gurmanski hram  (a catering company which feeds students from 5 high schools, with minimum of 1500 meals per day)    ÃÂÃÂ  Jack &amp; Joe Steak House  (with hundreds of customers)    ÃÂÃÂ  INSA  - A local real estate agencyÃÂÃÂ     ÃÂÃÂ  TopPower STUDIO  - a local fitness studio (with hundreds of members)   After using  inform8r  regularly for more than a month, the verdict was in: it is a better way forward, a cleaner way to send messages out and a preferable way of receiving them. The recipients focused more attention on each message, whether it was from the local football team announcing a rally or discount on tickets, or a yoga teacher letting her group know that the session would begin a half hour later that day), since it is not coming in the midst of a tidal wave of other things, as messages and ads do on social media).  The users were pleased that the app does not require or use any personal information, so there were  no privacy concerns  (which can be a big problem with social media). ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s ideal in this world of  GDPR  and when oneÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s goal is to spend less time looking at a screen, but to feel  secure  that youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re not missing anything important.  Inform8r really works and has already won over a city of over 100,000 people. ItÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s a cleaner, better way to send and receive messages, without personal information, and without social media. How can it change your world for the better?  Our teamÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ        ÃÂÃÂ   In Conclusion ÃÂÃÂ   You want to receive only the information you want to receive. Sounds so obvious as to not be worth mentioning, right? Well, just about every means of communication, from social media to mailing lists, wants to harvest as much information about you, personal information, as they can. They want to sell this information so other people can reach you, people or companies you didnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t actually sign up to hear from, or to send you whatever they want to send you, most of which you donÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t want to receive. Digital life can feel cluttered, clogging up your thoughts, bombarding your senses. inform8r lets you take back control.  ÃÂÃÂ   Get the information you want without giving away your personal data, and with zero risk of receiving data or ads or messages you didnÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>t sign up for. Clean communication, just the way you want it.   Thank you so much for your time, attention and support.

Not to worry, weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>ve got plans to keep you covered. i nform8r PRO  will be the next step for power users who either plan to use inform8r for business, such as marketing promotions, or for larger-scale messaging, for example a football league manager who needs to contact referees and teams, or headmaster of a school, who needs to contact many classes.   inform8r PRO , available in a desktop version, will facilitate larger-scale messaging in many ways.   ÃÂÃÂ manage multiple groups easily and smoothly -post a single message to multiple groups at once with our ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>write-once post-to-manyÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ technology    spread out your working area on your desktop, to drag and drop and import data files with contacts easily    unlimited number of groups created (the phone version supports 5 at a time)    purchase internal app advertising targeting specific group types    use GPS location technology to advertise content within the app    equip your groups with ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>BeaconÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ technology for in-house or external use (special group only in PRO)    support multilingual messaging, so you write a message in one language and it will be sent to your group members in their preferred languageÃÂÃÂ    ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ All this and more in  inform8r PRO . Coming as part of a Kickstarter stretch goal.ÃÂÃÂ  ÃÂÃÂ            Risks and challenges  We know youÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re supposed to have a ÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+009C>risks and challengesÃÂ¢<U+0080>ÃÂ section to your Kickstarter page, but weÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>re comfortable stating that there basically are no risks, and few challenges. The app is 90% done, extensively tested in a beta version, and works beautifully. Heck, it even looks cool (at least, we think so). The biggest risk is that we know other companies will take one look at inform8r and start making their own copycat version of the app or introduce its functionality into their pre-existing apps. It happens, and we get it. A good idea is a good idea."

It consists of 4 video inputs for cameras and other devices. A full built-in video switcher allowing switching of all video inputs, images and from the 2 built-in video players.  It has full chroma key for green screen and allows for 3 different virtual sets to be used at the same time. At present the output (what the viewer sees) can be recorded and live streamed to any rtmp supporting server like YouTube, Facebook, Twitch and many others.  This project we want to take Finncast Studio to another level with the output (what the viewer sees) as a  virtual camera . This is not just aimed specifically at  Skype , because it will be a virtual camera it will work with any software take can input a camera like Viber, Bigo Live and so on.  The way it will work is the output (what the viewer sees) will be put into a video stream and the video stream is sent to the virtual camera. The virtual Camera in return outputs Finncast Studio program output. The virtual camera is found on the computer like any other real camera except this camera does not need any drivers or capture cards.

Plant owners who travel often need to rely on DIY solutions, store-bought plant watering systems or their neighbours. These plant watering systems may not be optimal as they can stress out plants with overwatering and underwateringÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0093> and may not be the most time efficient. In comparison, Flora conserves water on a daily or weekly basis, allowing owners to raise the greenest plants while saving water. The broader vision is to help the world conserve water, one Flora at a time.    FloraÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s AI sensors measure the moisture level near the roots of the plants. Flora will understand how much water is being used or evaporated, it will then automatically dispense the exact amount of water needed for the plant.        Plants do more than look good, they enrich your immediate surroundings and are comforting fixtures in your homes.ÃÂÃÂ   As lifestyles grow increasingly fast-paced, having to nurture plants and keep to watering schedules can be demanding and cause unnecessary stress. The time taken to care for your plants adds up and can be put to better use.ÃÂÃÂ   Introducing Flora, the first-of-its-kind, artificial intelligence-enabled plant watering system that automatically waters any indoor houseplants to the highest precision. By detecting soil moisture levels, Flora will adjust for the frequency of water release and maintain the optimal moisture level in the soil. Its water tank ensures that plants can be watered for up to three weeks before being refilled.

Prime hunting is a distributed computing effort that spans thousands of computers globally. It's compute-intensive and takes many forms, utilising every type of hardware out there including desktop computers, servers and GPUs. Computers are particularly suited to finding a special type of prime called a  Mersenne Prime . The  Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)  is a collaborative effort to systematically test prime candidates, weeding out composites and finding new very large prime numbers.  Why crowd fund?  I want to build a server farm to perform efficient PRP testing on prime candidates in the search for the next biggest prime number. The results will be made public by submitting them to GIMPS. Efficient PRP testing at scale requires more resources than I have as a hobbyist. Initial outlay for the hardware is only part of it, running costs including electricity and maintenance end up being a much bigger factor when you consider that powerful hardware is running 24/7.  What makes a farm so efficient?   The compute hardware (GPUs) can share the enabling hardware to run them (motherboard, CPU, RAM, storage, PSU), reducing platform and running cost overhead    Using a titanium rated PSU wastes less energy converting from mains power to a form the PC can use which reduces running overhead. A titanium rated PSU is rated for a very high wattage and needs to be mostly occupied for best efficiency    The Radeon VII GPUs used are a perfect storm of efficiency specifically for this niche. They have a lot of performance per node, a lot of performance for the price, and are very power efficient thanks to the new 7nm manufacturing process they are on   What are the guarantees of the project?  The funding and stretch goal targets are based on the total cost and expected throughput of running the hardware at 100% load for however many years the goal is for. This is idealistic and not easily measurable, instead the guarantees are based on the number of record-attempting PRP tests it is estimated can be performed by the hardware in that time. This way at worst the date of completion may be slightly longer if unforeseen circumstances arise but the goals can still be measurably met.  Is there any point funding beyond the minimum target?  Yes there is. The minimum target is enough to slightly undercut current cloud service prices for PRP testing purposes. Increasing beyond the minimum target into the stretch goals allows for more nodes and/or more years of run time paid for, making every penny go further by reducing the impact of overheads like outlay, maintenance and platform costs.  Funding Goals        The estimated wavefront increases as the time frame does. This impacts the number of wavefront PRP tests that can be performed in a given time which is why doubling the run time slightly less than doubles the number of PRP tests performed   Cost Breakdown        Prices shown are estimates based on their current cost and may vary slightly at time of purchase    The float is for anything unexpected or hard to account for, helping pay for some unforeseen circumstance like hardware failure, the cost of downtime, an unexpectedly high electricity rate hike or otherwise    Cooling varies throughout the year dependent on climate and is estimated. It may be higher which is accounted for by the float   Projections        PRP test count is based on where the wavefront is expected to be during the crowdfunded tests. tl;dr larger candidates take longer to test. Short of someone finding a prime much larger than the current wavefront suggests is likely these numbers are reasonably accurate    The longer the hardware is used the more likely hardware failure is. 4 years is a particularly long time to run 24/7, itÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>s longer than IÃÂ¢<U+0080><U+0099>m prepared to guarantee the hardware will still be working for. At this timescale the estimated PRP count also cannot be accurately forecast    Cost per test in these projections is before accounting for Kickstarter fees    Wavefront refers to the smallest Mersenne number that is a candidate to be the next largest known Mersenne prime. This increases over time as tests complete and Mersenne numbers are determined composite   Is this an ""official"" GIMPS project?  No. This is a crowdfunding effort undertaken solely by me. I am a hobbyist prime hunter and hardware enthusiast. I know prime hunting and I know hardware, this project allows me to contribute to GIMPS while also getting to maintain some nice hardware.  Can I sponsor a particular candidate for testing and take credit for its discovery if it turns out to be prime?  Unfortunately not. Depending on rule interpretation sponsoring candidates in this way could be considered a breach of Kickstarter's anti-raffle rules. Not only that but the discoverer is the first human who notices that a prime has been found; ensuring that that's a backer would be time intensive and get in the way of automated systems that make administering the farm more manageable.  What happens to the GIMPS prize money if a record prime is found by one of the crowdfunded PRP tests?  Technically there is a $3000 reward if your computer finds the next record prime under 100,000,000 digits and you submit proof to GIMPS. In the unlikely event that that occurs I promise to refuse the prize money. The servers to maintain a distributed computing effort cost money and without them none of this would be possible.      Risks and challenges  The main risks include hardware failure and insufficient cooling in the summer months. I've taken steps to mitigate these factors including budgeting for maintenance, sourcing quality components, familiarising myself with the hardware to be used (including maintenance and benchmarking tests to ensure it fulfills the requirements), and accounting for underclocking the cards during summer to alleviate thermal constraints. A UPS will guard from power irregularities, every component will be tuned for efficiency and longevity. The kWh price of electricity is fixed for the majority of the planned duration of the farm. The target up-and-running date of the farm is September 2019, plenty of time to source components for the cheapest price, prepare the cards for longevity, assembling and testing the components, and assembling the farm into its final form and putting it to work."
