If stains are caused by oil-based fluids, such as skin oils or greasy food, the product will need to be washed or cleaned with stain remover.  We test the stain repellency for 30 washes at 30 degrees with ironing after each wash and no tumble-drying or bleaching. A lot depends on the type of machine, washing program, and detergent used, which is why we are not comfortable extending the guarantee above 30 washes for the stain repellency. Since the products need significantly less washing than a traditional cotton product 30 washes will give you a lot of wears.

Our shirts will not repel odour from cigarettes or cooking. Due to the many different variations and levels of perspiration we unfortunately cannot guarantee a specific amount of days the products will last before odour starts being absorbed into the fabric. We know that our current customers wear it 3,5 days. But we guarantee that the anti-bacterial treatment will be active for at least 100 washes.

Keep in mind that you have to wash LABFRESH shirts less, so itÃ\\x83Â\\x83Ã\\x82Â\\x83Ã\\x83Â\\x82Ã\\x82Â¢<U+0080><U+0099>s still a lot of wears.                            Risks and challenges  LABFRESH is fashion, not sportswear. You might be able to run a marathon in it without smelling, but that is not what our products are intended for.  With regards to stains we have been able to wash off any liquids and semi-liquids with water. However if you rub a substance into the fabric with force or if a very oily sauce comes in contact with the fabric, it will eventually make a slightly visible stain. You'll have to put it in the washer at 30 degrees to get the stain off.  Technology: It took as a full year to optimize our Pique fabric. The main explanation is that Pique fabric differs from our standard jersey t-shirt as it has a textured, waffle weave look whereas jersey (normal t-shirts) have a smooth, flat surface. This is particularly nice for a knit pique since its super breathable and can easily be worn in warm summer months. However this also means that a Pique fabric literally has tiny holes. We canÃ\\x83Â\\x83Ã\\x82Â\\x83Ã\\x83Â\\x82Ã\\x82Â¢<U+0080><U+0099>t work magic on a fabric, so holes will be holes, which means bigger spills might make your body a little bit wet (without staining the fabric). Besides this the pique fabric is as stain repellant as any other product we make.  Production delays and unforeseen obstacles are always a risk. This is however not our first rodeo. We have made more than 20,000 t-shirts with our manufacturer and we are confident they will produce the pique fabric on time as well.\""

      " english below el sup paddle surf o stand up paddle board es un deporte fantstico es lo ms parecido a caminar sobre el agua pero no tiene la estabilidad de un kayak al ir de pie subimos el centro de gravedad somos ms inestables y es ms difcil de dominar en un recorrido largo o cuando estamos aprendiendo nos sentamos para descansar o estabilizarnos y no hay una forma cmoda de hacerlo existen asientos para los paddle surf copiados de los kayaks pero no son nada cmodos espalda recta y comodidad en las piernas rodillas y tobillos al mismo tiempo podemos cambiar de posicin y llevar dos remos fcilmente de una pala para ir de pie y de dos palas para ir sentado el paddlesit multiplica las posibilidades de uso qu es el paddle sit el paddlesit es un nuevo concepto de asiento para el paddle surf est diseado para ir de rodillas con unos cojines ligeramente elevados donde apoyar las piernas que imitan la forma del empeine y un asiento central que se puede regular en altura e inclinacin repartiendo el peso del cuerpo de forma equilibrada esta posicin es tan cmoda que es habitual realizarla en yoga y meditacin cmo sentarse en el paddlesit el paddlesit tienen varias opciones de uso todas estas alternativas lo convierten en un aparato muy verstil que nos permitir multiplicar las posibilidades de este deporte por ejemplo si hacemos una travesa ejercitaremos msculos diferentes y  haremos un ejercicio ms completo uno de los inconvenientes del paddle surf es que hace falta un poco de prctica para aprenderlo con el paddlesit usted lo podr disfrutar desde el principio otro de los problemas habituales es que un poco de viento hace que nuestro cuerpo acte como vela y nos puede dificultar volver a la orilla el paddlesit aumenta nuestra estabilidad y nos proporciona una potencia extra que nos puede sacar de un apuro si las condiciones meteorolgicas empeoran posicin principal de rodillas el paddlesit est diseado para sentarse de rodillas esta posicin es poco habitual para la mayora de la gente pero es sorprendentemente cmoda y perfecto para mantener la espalda recta  segunda posicin sentado  uno de los puntos fuertes del paddlesit es la posibilidad de cambiar de posicin al contrario que los kayaks cualquier postura se hace incmoda si se mantiene mucho tiempo de esta forma podemos usarlo como un asiento convencional inclinando el asiento central casi vertical para usarlo de respaldo tal como se ve en el dibujo con un poco de prctica usted podr cambiar de posicin en ruta tercera posicin de pie el paddlesit dispone de un alojamiento central que nos permite llevar un segundo remo esto es muy til si queremos remar de pie posicin para la que el paddle surf fue diseado para ello cambiamos de remo y desplazamos un poco hacia delante el paddlesit para situarnos en el centro y remamos normalmente cuarta posicin tumbado esta posicin nos permite relajarnos al mximo incluso remar usando el asiento central como reposacabezas para ello puede despegar el velcro de los cojines de las piernas y darles la vuelta otros usos una de las posiciones habituales de meditacin en yoga es la llamada postura del hroe  virasana que consiste en sentarse de rodillas ayudado de un banco de meditacin el paddlesit facilita esta posicin hacindola ms cmoda permitiendo la espalda recta y las piernas relajadas sin forzar los tobillos la versatilidad del asiento nos permite como hemos visto numerosas posibilidades limitadas slo por nuestra imaginacin podemos utilizarla como hemos visto como accesorio en el yoga como asiento en una mesa baja para trabajar en lugares bajos etc en pareja   el paddlesit nos proporciona una gran estabilidad que permite que lo usen dos personas en una misma tabla con la combinacin que nos sea mas cmoda de rodillas o sentado y cmo fijamos el paddlesit a la tabla  el paddlesit est concebido para que no necesite ser amarrado a la tabla la mayora de las tablas de paddle disponen de una superficie de gomaeva de gran adherencia por lo que el paddlesit no se mover por esta razn no suministramos correas de fijacin al estar suelto lo podemos desplazar hacia delante cuando vayamos a remar de pie para situarnos en el centro de la tabla no obstante hemos diseado el paddlesit con unos agujeros laterales que usted podr utilizar para atarlo a la tabla mediante correas si lo considera conveniente otra opcin es atarlo simplemente con un leash o invento a la tabla para que en caso de volcar no se separe de esta  y si se cae al agua flota  no lo vas a perder fcilmente paddle sit para empresas por su elegancia y simplicidad el paddle surf es un deporte de moda en todos los lugares de costa ros o lagunas interiores hay empresas que lo ofrecen para alquilar o para dar cursos el inconveniente es que es un poco ms difcil que el kayak y se necesita un poco de prctica el paddlesit ofrece a las empresas la posibilidad de hacer travesas utilizando un remo de doble pala a modo de kayak que da a la tabla potencia similar y estabilidad mejorando adems la comodidad de esta forma podemos hacer tramos de pie con el remo de paddle surf alternando posiciones de sentado de rodillas o de la forma tradicional ofreciendo una actividad ms completa y divertida las empresas que incluyan en el alquiler actividades o cursos de paddle surf con el paddlesit destacarn sobre la competencia diseo el paddlesit est diseado en primer lugar pensando en la comodidad realizamos numerosos prototipos para llegar a este resultado por ejemplo la altura de los cojines para las piernas es crtica cuanto ms altos ms cmodo es el asiento pero demasiado altos nos elevan con respecto a la tabla y hacen la remada ms incmoda llegamos a esa solucin despus de probar multitud de combinaciones la solucin de fijarlos con velcro nos permite colocarlos en la posicin para que se adapten perfectamente al ngulo del empeine la posibilidad de regular el asiento central nos permite inclinarlo ms o menos segn la situacin por ejemplo cuando queremos ms velocidad aumentamos la potencia de remada e inclinamos nuestro cuerpo hacia delante regulando el asiento para ese ngulo determinado en cambio si remamos de forma ms relajada nos conviene el asiento ms horizontal para la esttica buscamos una solucin minimalista el paddle surf es en s mismo un modelo sencillez una tabla plana y un remo por eso evitamos diseos complicados y ostentosos materiales de calidad elegimos no obstante materiales de calidad como  gomaespuma de clulas cerradas no absorbe el agua por lo que flota   tapizado  de un material adaptado a las condiciones marinas y suave al tacto piezas metlicas todas inoxidables de acero y aluminio base plstica realizada en un material  reciclable rene las propiedades de resistencia y rigidez que buscbamos nuestro compromiso es que el paddlesit tenga una vida lo ms larga posible para evitar la obsolescencia para ello hemos usado en su construccin materiales durables y nos comprometemos a suministrar cada uno de los elementos por separado as empez todo nac y me cri junto al mar en el parque natural de cabo de gata un lugar fantstico de acantilados volcnicos y aguas transparentes con fondos marinos repletos de vida me encanta el cabo de gata y acab trabajando en l como gua marino en el cabo a fondo donde realizo excursiones guiadas en barco el paddle surf me llam la atencin desde el principio y en cuanto lo prob me enganch con el paso del tiempo el cabo de gata ha pasado de ser un lugar aislado y desconocido a ser apreciado cada vez por ms gente por la belleza limpia de su paisaje semidesrtico las actividades marinas como el kayak han proliferado al calor de la gente que busca hacer turismo activo en lugar de quedarse nicamente tostndose al sol yo me preguntaba porqu el paddle surf siendo un deporte estticamente tan bonito y completo no terminaba de cuajar la respuesta es que es ms difcil no todo el mundo se sube a la primera se avanza menos que un kayak y le afecta ms el viento por lo que no era adecuado para una travesa si quera dar ms versatilidad la paddle surf haba que ponerle un asiento me puse a buscar si haba sillas adaptadas para la tabla y encontr las mismas sillas de los kayaks las prob pero me resultaron incmodas me fij entonces en cmo se sentaba la gente para no perder el equilibrio y la forma ms habitual es de rodillas  una posicin que ofrece una buena remada pero que es muy incmoda deba de haber entonces una silla que se adaptara a esta postura busqu en internet y no encontr nada encontr sillas ergonmicas de oficina y numerosas e ingeniosas soluciones para los trabajadores de la construccin que estn muchas horas de rodillas pero nada para el paddle surf as que me arremangu y me puse manos a la obra pronto descubr que una cosa es tener una idea que funcione y otra muy distinta es fabricarla y venderla afortunadamente mi amigo liberto vino al rescate liberto es propietario junto con su familia de carretillas amate  esta empresa innovadora ha revolucionado el trabajo de la agricultura de almera con nuevas soluciones para invernaderos puntera a nivel mundial han desarrollado incluso un nuevo modelo de tractor la tizona adaptado para trabajar en lugares estrechos esta empresa tena la experiencia y capacidad necesaria para hacer un producto de calidad liberto es adems un gran aficionado al mar y a los deportes de remo enseguida capt las ventajas de la idea y decidimos asociarnos para este proyecto con su empuje y experiencia el paddlesit ha pasado de ser un prototipo a obtener el acabado profesional que buscamos y aqu tenis el resultado english version sup paddle surf or stand up paddle board is a fantastic sport its as close as you can get to walking on water but it doesnt have the stability of a kayak as you stand up your center of gravity rises with you and you become more unstable managing the board becomes more difficult on a long trip or while you are still learning youll want to sit and rest or just get your balance back and normally there is no comfortable way to do it there are kayak style seats available for paddle surfers but these really dont give you the comfort and support you need a straight back and comfort and support for legs knees and ankles paddlesit allows you to easily change your position and there is space for you can carry an additional paddle a main paddle for standing and a kayak style paddle for sitting paddlesit gives you a variety of new ways to use your sup what is the paddle sit paddlesit is a new seat concept for paddle boards it is designed to be used in a kneeling position with slightly elevated ergonomically designed cushions to support your legs and a seat that can be adjusted for both height and angle distributing your weight and giving you maximum balance this position is so comfortable that youll find terrestrial versions of the set in yoga and meditation classes how to sit in the paddlesit there are several ways you can use paddlesit  this flexibility extends your enjoyment of the sport and allows to participate in a wider range of conditions  youll exercise different muscles groups depending on the position you adopt and get a more complete workout one of the disadvantages of stand up paddle board is that you need a little practice to get started with paddlesit you can get on the water and enjoy your board from day one another common problem is that a little wind makes your body act like a sail and can make it difficult to return to shore the paddlesit increases your stability and gives you  that extra power that can get you out of a jam if weather conditions start to deteriorate main position kneeling the paddlesit is designed to be used in a kneeling position  although not immediately familiar this position is surprisingly comfortable and perfect for keeping your back straight  second option conventional one of the strong points of paddlesit is the possibility to change to a sitting position any position becomes uncomfortable if it is held for a long time this way we can use paddlesit as a conventional seat inclining the central seat almost vertically to use as a backrest with a little practice you will be able to change position on the go third option standing the paddlesit has a central housing that allows you to carry a second paddle  this is very useful if we want to paddle standing the position for which the paddle surf was designed to do this we change paddles and move the paddlesit a little forward to place ourselves in the center and paddle normally fourth option laying down  this position allows us to relax as much as possible even whilst paddle using the central seat or the leg cushions as headrests  to do this you can detach the velcro from the leg cushions and turn them around other uses a common position for yoga meditation is the socalled hero pose or virasana which consists of sitting on your knees helped by a meditation bench the paddlesit facilitates this position making it more comfortable allowing you to keep your back straight and legs relaxed without putting undue force on your ankles with a friend paddlesit gives you much more stability on your board  you can even take a friend with you  wed recommend you adopt a sitting or kneeling position if you are taking a passenger how to attach the paddlesit to your board you dont need any special equipment or ties to attach your paddlesit most paddle boards have a high grip rubber surface so the paddlesit will not move no fixing straps are needed as your paddlesit is not fixed you can easily move it forward on your board when you choose to paddle standing up and need to stand in the center of your board however we have designed the paddlesit with some side holes that you can use to tie it to the board with straps if you prefer another option is to tie it simply with a leash to the board so that in case of overturning it does not separate from it and if it falls into the water it floats  youre not going to lose it easily paddlesit for companies elegance and simplicity makes paddle surfing a fashionable sport on the coast rivers or inland lagoons youll find companies that offer boards to rent or who are giving courses the disadvantage is that it is a little more difficult to get started than kayaking for example  and a little practice is needed youll be able to take clients with a wider range of skills on your routes  giving your clients the option of changing positions also allows for a more varied and complete fun activity companies that include paddlesit in their rental activities or courses are going to stand out from the competition design paddlesit is designed primarily with comfort in mind we made numerous prototypes before we got it just right for example the height of the leg support is critical  the higher the seat the more comfortable it is but the higher we are the less comfortable it is to paddle it took us several iterations to get this right  making the leg supports adjustable allows the user to tailor the shape easily to their body form  allowing the back supportseat to tilt means that you can adjust it for power paddling by inclining the body forward  tilting it back gives a more relaxed position for a gentler activity for aesthetics we looked for a minimalist solution the paddle surf is in itself a simple model a flat board and an oar thats why we have avoided complicated and ostentatious designs quality materials we choose quality materials such as closedcell foam it does not absorb water so it floats upholstered in a material adapted to marine conditions and soft to the touch metallic pieces all stainless steel and aluminum plastic base made of a  recyclable material combining the properties of resistance and rigidity that we were looking for our commitment is that the paddlesit has as long a life as possible to avoid obsolescence for this reason we have used durable materials in its construction and we are committed to supplying each of the elements separately  thats how it all started  i was born and raised by the sea in cabo de gata natural park a fantastic place of volcanic cliffs and clear waters with seabeds full of life i love cabo de gata and ended up working on its waters as a marine guide at the deep end where and i do boat routes at the company el cabo a fondo  paddle surfing caught my attention from the beginning and as soon as i tried it i was hooked with the passing of time cabo de gata has gone from being an isolated and unknown place to being appreciated by more and more people for the clean beauty of its semidesert landscape marine activities such as kayaking have proliferated with people seeking to do active tourism rather than just sunbathing i wondered why paddle surfing being such an aesthetically pleasing and complete sport wasnt more popular the answer is that it is more difficult not everyone will be able to stand and paddle first time out you cover less distance than with a kayak and your more affected by the wind  altogether this makes the sup less than ideal for long and medium distance trips if you wanted to give more versatility to paddle surf it needed a seat i began to look if there were seats adapted for paddle boards but the only thing i found were based on lightweight kayak seats i tried them but they were uncomfortable i then looked at how people sat so as not to lose their balance and the most common pose is kneeling a position that offers a good paddle but is very uncomfortable there had to be a chair to suit this position i searched the internet and found nothing i found ergonomic office chairs and numerous ingenious solutions for construction workers who are on their knees for many hours but nothing for paddle surfing so i i set to the task i soon discovered that its one thing to have an idea that works and another to make it and sell it fortunately my friend liberto came to the rescue liberto runs the family business carretillas amate  this innovative company has revolutionized the work of agriculture in almeria with new solutions for greenhouses even developing a tractor to work in confined spaces which it markets internationally this company had the experience and ability to make a quality product liberto is also a great fan of the sea and paddle sports he immediately grasped the advantages of the idea and we decided to partner for this project with his drive and experience the paddlesit has gone from being a prototype to obtaining the professional finish we are looking for and here you have the result risks and challenges el paddlesit est abalado por dos empresas  el cabo a fondo sl que cuenta con casi  aos de experiencia y cuenta con  aos de certificado de excelencia en tripadvisor que lo certifican como una empresa que antepone la satisfaccin de sus clientes por encima de todo  carretillas amate sl que fabricar el paddlesit tiene una larga trayectoria y es pionera en fabricacin de todo tipo de maquinaria para la agricultura y que est considerada como una empresa innovadora con gran nmero de diseos patentados y que exporta sus creaciones a todo el

      "mein name ist manfred fixl  ich komme aus obersterreich aus dem mhlviertel der frheren webereihochburg stereichs in meinem heimatsort befand sich auch die einzige textilhochschule sterreichs schon als kind begeisterte mich dieses handwerk und ich konnte bereits im frhen alter durch familire verknpfungen auch in die entwicklung und forschung der textilhochschule tiefen einblick nehmen  im verlauf meines berufsweges kam ich spter mit groen unternehmen der professionellen gebudereinigungsbranche zusammen als ich die dimensionen des enormen verbrauchs von krankmachenden und umweltschdigenden chemikalien zur reinigung in meiner alltglichen arbeit wahrnahm lste dies in mir den wunsch aus etwas gegen diese flut von chemie und mikroplastik zu unternehmen natrlich wusste ich von der antibakteriellen wirkung des silbers und der verwendung in textilien wie zb in unterwsche zur linderung von allergien und ausschlgen auch gibt es bereits spltcher am markt die mit silberhaltigen imprgnierungen behandelt wurden um das wachstum von geruchsbildenden bakterien zu verhindern hier war also mein ausgangspunkt doch kann antibakterielles silber in einer textilie berhaupt eine derartige effektivitt erzielen dass ruhigen gewissens auf desinfektionsmittel verzichtet werden kann wie stellt man ein reinigungstuch her dass le und fette aufnimmt obwohl man nur mit reinem wasser wischt manfred fixl nach vielen jahren intensiver tftelei untersttzung durch rzte umweltmediziner textil und reinigungsfachleute aber auch inklusive kreativer pausen und jeder menge prototypen die den eigenen hohen anspruch an perfektion noch nicht erfllen konnten ist heute die zeit reif der welt die superfaser vorzustellen eine in sterreich entwickelte und in deutschland produzierte hightechtextilie mit auergewhnlichen eigenschaften medicine  optic  health weitere informationen und komplette produktpalette unter website  der shop ist lediglich zur bewltigung des zuknftigen geschfts bereits fertig erstellt keines der gezeigten produkte ist aktuell verfgbar the online shop has only been created for future business none of the displayed products is currently available oder folge uns bei instagram  das silber so filigran verwebt und untrennbar mit der hauptfaser verbunden dies war meine grte herausforderung die mittlerweile perfekt gemeistert wurde die verarbeiteten fasern werden vor dem einweben mittels einem speziellen verfahren angeschliffen damit wird zum einen die schmutz aufnehmende oberflche starkt vergrert zum anderen ermglicht diese beschaffenheit ein tieferes eindringen in poren die in mikroskopischem mastab jede oberflche besitzt auf diese weise entfernt die microclean superfaser tief sitzende verunreinigungen die nur durch den einsatz von reinem wasser herausgelst werden zudem wurde in mehreren gutachten von behrden und unabhngigen instituten zweifelsfrei besttigt dass oberflchen die mit der microclean superfaser und reinem wasser gereinigt wurden zu  von keimen und erregern befreit sind nach gngigen testmethoden fr marktbliche desinfektionsmittel doch darauf gehe ich spter noch ein es entwickelt sich weltweit ein immer strkeres bewusstsein wie der ungehemmte einsatz von chemikalien und die vermllung der gewsser und umwelt durch mikroplastik unsere lebensgrundlage kontinuierlich zerstrt eigentlich sind wir verpflichtet alles zu unternehmen um diesen wahnsinn zu stoppen leider haben wir uns stark an die nutzung von chemischen reinigungsmitteln gewhnt alleine der geruch von reinigern und chlor wird in vielen kpfen mit hygiene gleich gesetzt diese konditionierungen mssen aufgelst werden viele disruptive technologien die nachhaltig sind und der umwelt mehr dienen als dem kapital werden nicht angemessen gefrdert und etabliert manchmal sogar ausgebremst mit unserer innovativen superfaser knnen millionen tonnen chemie und kunststoffabfall weltweit vermieden werden in allen lebens und arbeitsbereichen ich habe diese produkte leidenschaftlich unter groen anstrengungen und mit eigenen mitteln zur vollen marktfhigkeit gebracht nun kann sofort mit der ersten greren und deshalb konomisch sinnvollen serienproduktion gestartet werden bei der herstellung wird mit komplexen verfahren gearbeitet welche schlecht bis berhaupt nicht kopierbar sind ziel dieses crowdfundingprojekts ist es mglichst viele menschen zu erreichen die allesamt anwender und fans unserer wertvollen produkte werden und genauso groe freude haben an diesem groen gesundheits und umweltprojekt wie ich bis heute wurden lediglich einige prototypen der medicine line in kleinserie hergestellt und an einen ausgewhlten kreis zu testzwecken und fr die erstellung von bakteriologischen gutachten verteilt mit der wucht von kickstarter mchten wir nun erstmals grere chargen herstellen und aus dem damit erreichten wirtschaftlichen erfolg die weiterentwicklung der health line fr krperpflege und demakeup finanzieren damit auch bei diesen anwendungen auf tonnenweise abfall wie wattepads und reinigungsmittel verzichtet werden kann abgerundet wird die produktpalette dann schliesslich mit der optic line die handydisplays ohne reinigungs und desinfektionsmittel keimfrei und fettfrei subert genauso eignet sich die optic line fr bildschirme brillen linsen und objektive microclean superfasern  mit jahrelanger lebensdauer ermglichen eine porentiefe und professionelle reinigung nur mit reinem wasser und tten dabei   aller keime und bakterien entwickelt in sterreich hergestellt in deutschland zum

jausenplatz vor und nach reinigung mit microcleansuperfiber und reinem wasser my name is manfred fixl  i am from upper austria from the mhlviertel the former weaving stronghold of austria my home town was also the only textile technical university in austria already as a child i was enthusiastic about this craft and from an early age i was able to get a deep insight into the development and research of the textile academy through family connections  in the course of my career i later came into contact with large companies in the professional cleaning industry when i noticed the dimensions of the enormous consumption of diseasecausing and environmentally damaging chemicals for cleaning in my everyday work this triggered my desire to do something about this flood of chemistry and microplastics of course i knew about the antibacterial effect of silver and its use in textiles such as underwear to alleviate allergies and rashes there are also dishtowels on the market that have been treated with silvercontaining impregnations to prevent the growth of odourforming bacteria so this was my starting point but can antibacterial silver in a fabric achieve such effectiveness that disinfectants can be dispensed with without any doubt how do you make a cleaning cloth that absorbs oils and fats even though you only wipe with pure water after many years of intensive tinkering support from doctors environmental physicians textile and cleaning experts but also including creative breaks and lots of prototypes that have not yet been able to meet my own high standards of perfection it is time today to present the superfibre to the world developed and manufactured in austria the silver so filigree woven and inseparably connected with the main fibre this was my greatest challenge which has now been mastered perfectly the processed fibres are sanded with a special process before weaving on the one hand this greatly increases the amount of the dirtabsorbing surface and on the other hand this structures allow deeper penetration into microscopically small unevennesses which almost every surface has in addition several expert opinions from authorities and independent institutes have confirmed beyond doubt that  of surfaces cleaned with microclean cloths and pure water are free of germs and pathogens according to standard test methods for commercially available disinfectants but i will go into this later there is a growing awareness worldwide how the uninhibited use of chemicals and the littering of waters and the environment by microplastics continuously destroys our basis of life actually we are obliged to do everything in our power to stop this madness unfortunately we have become very accustomed to the use of chemical cleaning agents the smell of cleaners and chlorine alone is equated with hygiene in many peoples minds these conditionings must be dissolved many disruptive technologies which are sustainable and serve the environment more than profits are not adequately promoted and established sometimes even slowed down with our innovative super fiber millions of tons of chemicals and microplastic waste can be avoided worldwide in all areas of life and work i have made great efforts to bring the first type of these products close to perfection now we can start immediately with the first larger production the aim of this crowdfunding project is to create the economic conditions to become able to expand the line of products by the health line for body care and demakeup to make it also in this category possible to save  chemical products and waste afterwards the product range will be completed by the optic line an even more refined variation which is being used for smartphone displays to clean those germ and bacteriafree and remove any grease of course the optic line will be perfectly suitable for other screens glasses lenses and other optics too and of course the larger the community of users the higher the positive impact for our planet kickstarter is perfect to get the ball rolling and save the environment thousands of tons of chemicals and plastics microclean superfibers with a long service life

airq denkt weiter und geht weiter als jedes andere luftmessgert so unterscheidet airq die messgren durch dezidierte sensoren ein beispiel anders als airq differenzieren viele andere messgerte nicht zwischen voc und kohlenstoffdioxid co der ecowert ist dort nur eine extrem grobe schtzung oder wird gar nicht erst mit einbezogen  anders beim airq airq vereint noch weit mehr er ist auch als rauchmelder und lrmpegelmesser einsetzbar durch algorithmen welche im hintergrund laufen knnen zudem stoffe und situationen erkannt werden welche so bisher nicht erfassbar waren wie zum beispiel airq sagt schimmel treffsicher vorher die anwesenheit von menschen im raum lsst sich erkennen geffnete fenster werden erfasst zeitliche zusammenhnge werden automatisch bestimmt und in die auswertung einbezogen mit den umfassenden daten des airq kann erstmals berhaupt eine ernsthafte ursachenanalyse durchgefhrt werden luftdaten erfassen airq kann berall aufgestellt werden  im wohnzimmerregal auf dem kinderzimmersideboard im schlafzimmer auf dem nachttisch oder auf dem schreibtisch im bro wichtig ist nur die daten sollten dort erfasst werden wo sie und ihre familie oder arbeitskollegen sich am meisten aufhalten gesundheit und leistung airq analysiert fortlaufend alle stoffe der lokalen atemluft und bewertet den einfluss auf die krperliche gesundheit und leistungsfhigkeit auf basis von grenzwerten des umweltbundesamtes empfehlungen der who sowie wissenschaftlichen studien berechnet airq einen gesundheitsindex und einen leistungsindex so werden die komplexen zusammenhnge verstndlich aufbereitet und fr jeden bewertbar  airq gesundheitsindex tun sie ihrer gesundheit etwas gutes indem sie jederzeit wissen wie sich die aktuelle luft auf ihr wohlbefinden und die gesundheit auswirkt und wie sich die luftqualitt verbessern lsst  airq leistungsindex bleiben sie fit und konzentriert beim arbeiten durch die exakte auswertung ihrer raumluft und individueller tipps fr eine optimale broluft die indexe werden auf dem airq durch leds angezeigt im lebensbedrohlichen bereich lst der airq einen akustischen alarm aus  zum beispiel bei rauch oder kohlenmonoxidbelastung wer mehr wissen mchte kann in der app jeden einzelnen wert im detail untersuchen daten in der app auswerten die airq app ist ihre zentrale fr den tglichen luftqualittscheck  unkompliziert und  abrufbar unsere intelligente airq app liefert ihnen nicht nur einen rundumblick zur luftqualitt auf ihr ios oder androidsmartphone mit hilfe der airq app werden alle informationen des airq zusammengetragen verarbeitet und visualisiert die app besitzt dabei drei hauptfunktionen  die zusammenfassung der raumluftdaten findet ber den airq gesundheits und den airq leistungsindex statt beide indexe geben einen leicht verstndlichen berblick auch werden direkt tipps zur verbesserung der individuellen luftsituation gegeben  die datenanalyse erlaubt ein tieferes einsteigen in die einzelnen luftbestandteile und deren hintergrnde jede messgre kann verglichen und im verlauf betrachtet werden auch gibt es alle informationen zu jedem stoff verstndlich aufbereitet die umfassende bersicht aller grenzwerte erlaubt eine genaue einschtzung der eigenen luftsituation so viel mhe hat sich bisher niemand gemacht  die app ist ihr individueller gesundheitsberater fortlaufend wertet sie im hintergrund die verschiedenen daten zu gasen und partikeln aus und kann auch auenluftdaten mit einbeziehen jede situation besitzt eine einzigartige signatur die sich oft durch die kombination von verschiedenen sensordaten identifizieren lsst ber die zeit wird der airq gesundheitsberater immer smarter da er die individuellen daten immer besser zu verstehen lernt gesundheitsbewusste menschen sie erhalten umfassende und transparente informationen ber das wichtigste lebensmittel  die atemluft allergiker sie werden frhzeitig gewarnt wenn belastende und kritische luftsituationen allergien auslsen oder verstrken knnen familien kinder sind besonders anfllig fr schadstoffbelastungen airq kann dazu beitragen dass ihre kinder von allergien verschont bleiben und in einer umgebung mit gesunder luft aufwachsen senioren ltere menschen sind genau wie kinder anflliger fr schadstoffe jeglicher art durch die einfach zu verstehende lichtampel am airq ist es auch weniger technik versierten menschen

messdaten zugriff auf die dateien ber eine mobilapp android  ios rund  prozent unserer zeit verbringen wir in innenrumen  und die luft darin ist oftmals weniger gut als wir denken dies wollten wir genauer wissen fanden aber nichts passendes auf dem markt also haben wir mit airq den luftanalysator entwickelt den wir immer haben wollten unsere mission einfach und immer wissen was aktuell in der luft liegt um gesund und ohne bedenken ein und ausatmen zu knnen dr daniel lehmann  der ideengeber fr ihn spielen die themen gesundheit und fitness eine bedeutende rolle aus privatem interesse und mangels verfgbarkeit von lsungen hat er  die idee eines multigassensors entwickelt der die parameter der luft einfach und schnell aber dennoch przise und zuverlssig bestimmt beim bau der ersten version des airq hat ihm seine ber jhrige erfahrung in der grundlagenforschung und der entwicklung neuer sensortechnologien an der technischen universitt chemnitz sehr geholfen mario krsi  der strippenzieher mario mchte jedem die mglichkeit geben selbststndig die qualitt der luft zu messen deshalb war er schon frh von der idee zum airq begeistert und bringt sein wirtschaftliches knowhow mit ein er selbst liebt es die daten in den zahlreichen airq charts zu verfolgen und die ursachen fr schlechte luft aufzudecken auerdem ist mario leider geplagt von allergien seitdem er sich mit dem thema luftanalyse befasst hat er endlich eine erklrung was die ursachen sein knnten er will nun auf jeden fall vermeiden dass auch seine kinder allergien bekommen mit dem airq hat jeder sein eigenes kleines labor und kann selbst entscheiden alexander stinka  der softwareentwickler der airq misst jeden tag unzhlige daten aus der umgebungsluft  alexander will nicht dass die nutzer mit dieser flut allein gelassen werden er bringt sie in form und zwar mit der airq app an dem modernen und intuitiv nutzbaren interface sowie den wertvollen gesundheits und leistungsindizes ist seine entwicklerexpertise sofort zu erkennen er feilt bereits an weiteren genialen features fr den gesundheitsassistenten der airq app was er derzeit am spannendsten findet dass sich in der smart homeevolution immer mehr mglichkeiten fr den airq erffnen den wirtschaftlichen rahmen fr den airq bietet die corant gmbh mit sitz in chemnitz und leipzig corant entstand als ausgrndung aus dem institut fr physik der tu

und der anschlieenden produktion durch technische schwierigkeiten beim elektronikdesign und engpsse in der produktion kann es zu verzgerungen bei der auslieferung kommen wir haben unsere kickstarter kampagne bereits lange geplant bewusst jedoch bis zum heutigen tag gewartet um fr unsere untersttzer und backer mglichst viele risikofaktoren auszuschlieen oder zumindest stark zu reduzieren so konnten wir bereits alle kernfunktionen ausgiebig testen bei uns befinden sich mehrere funktionierende prototypen im einsatz  teilweise seit ber einem jahr auch bei einigen testern kindergarten abendlokal zu hause bros konnte der airq schon erprobt werden wir konnten die mobilapp seit lngerem im realeinsatz testen und feedback von unseren testen sammeln was uns auch dazu bewegt hat das optische design zu verndern  technisch bleibt alles wie es bisher ist und funktioniert die firmware hat sich ber die vergangenen monate kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt und ist stabil auch die webanwendung besitzt bereits die meisten funktionen jetzt sind wir an einem punkt an dem wir ihre untersttzung bei kickstarter bentigen um die letzten schritte gemeinsam zu gehen und den airq zu produzieren\n",

      "foreigen languages whitepaper in englisch        english presentation      english short description   english video  whitepaper in french    video espanol  werde klimaretter nicht meckern sondern machen erstellt mit fast jeder findet die proteste der schler gegen die tatenlosigkeit im klimaschutz gut nur was tust du dagegen der verzicht auf die currywurst oder das auto alleine hilft nicht mehr viel einen baum zu pflanzen wre ein sehr guter anfang aber im selben moment werden weltweit tausende bume gefllt wenn wir wirklich etwas erreichen wollen mssen wir schon ein paar hundert millionen hektar wste in den nchsten  jahren begrnen mit irrigationnets ist das nicht nur mglich sondern investoren knnen damit sogar noch geld verdienen denn nur durch einen wirtschaftlichen ansatz kann eine lsung auch in der breite umgesetzt werden und somit etwas bewirken irrigationnets unsere lsung zur wstenbegrnung ist ganz einfach anstatt meerwasser sehr aufwndig und teuer zu entsalzen lassen wir dieses nur in sehr groen mengen salzfrei verdunsten mit der khlung fr ein  mw pvkraftwerk verdunsten wir tglich  millionen liter meerwasser und produzieren  millionen kubikmeter kalter feuchter luft das trinkwasser holen sich dann die pflanzen aus der luft das geschieht auf einer sehr groen flche von mehreren tausend hektar das nennt man dann auch morgentau und dieser natrliche prozess ist eine sehr effektive und kostenlose form der mikrobewsserung fr jeden einzelnen grashalm potential in der weidewirtschaft das bei der verdunstung entstehende salz kann aufgefangen und als streusalz verkauft werden das salz bleibt nicht in den netzen hngen sondern wird immer ausgesplt und unter den netzen gesammelt auch absichtlich stark versalzene und mehrfach getrocknete netze konnten selbst mit bersttigter salzlsung komplett ausgesplt werden absichtlich versalzene netze  wieder vollstndig ausgewaschene netze hier noch ein weiteres video welches die funktionsweise von irrigationnets erklrt in unseren sehr kostengnstigen netzen hngen millionen kleiner und kleinster wassertropfen bei geringem windwiderstand in der luft diese kleinen tropfen haben eine geringe masse aber dafr eine sehr groe oberflche woraus eine sehr hohe verdunstungsrate resultiert da die tropfen nicht zerspringen sondern nur langsam an den netzen entlanglaufen werden kaum salzmolekle an die luft abgegeben und wir haben eine salzfreie oberflchenverdunstung   wir produzieren mit irrigationnets also nur sehr groe mengen kalter salzfreier feuchter luft mit dieser luft knnen wir im ersten schritt berhrungsfrei solarkraftwerke khlen die dadurch bis zu  mehr strom produzieren das ist weit mehr zustzliche energie als wir fr den betrieb von irrigationnets bentigen das kraftwerk verkauft somit normal seinen strom und ist eine klassische berechenbare und vor allem finanzierbare investition mit kostenlosen zustzlichen nutzen fr die umwelt im zweiten schritt khlen und befeuchten wir die umliegende landwirtschaft im umkreis von  km wodurch hier ca  mehr ertrag erziehlt werden kann salzfreie solarkhlung  agrarbefeuchtung mit meerwasser im dritten schritt versorgen wir die umliegenden drregebiete im umkreis von  km mit hheren mengen an morgentau bei schwachen wind der strke    kmh sogar bis zu  km am tag dabei wird natrlich nicht jedes gebiet jeden tag versorgt je nach windrichtung geht die feuchtigkeit mal in die eine und mal in die andere richtung das ist jedoch ein groer vorteil denn pflanzen knnen sehr gut eine trockenphase berstehen bei drei monaten drre am stck sieht das natrlich anders aus wenn aber nur an  von  tagen geringere temperaturen eine hhere luftfeuchtigkeit und grere mengen an morgentau auftreten dann kann sich die natur unter diesen bedingungen sehr viel besser entwickeln statistische wasserverteilung versuche im trockenfeldbau zeigen deutlich dass schon geringe unterschiede in der versorgung sehr groe unterschiede in der entwicklung ausmachen knnen mit irrigationnets knnen wir somit auf sehr groen gebieten eine ganz neue form des trockenfeldbaus ermglichen bei unserm untersttzten trockenfeldbau ndern wir das mikroklima durch die kalte feuchte luft in der region das alles ohne betriebskosten oder teure gewchshuser geringe unterschiede in der feuchtigkeit haben groe auswirkungen auf die entwicklung doch damit es so weit kommt brauchen wir auch deine untersttzung bei der produktentwicklung und der markterschlieung denn auch mit unseren zwei ersten funktionierenden prototypen in berlin konnten wir noch keine investoren oder kunden berzeugen jeder mchte gerne das fertige produkt   jahre langzeiterfahrung sehen aber niemand traut sich der erste kunde zu sein die ersten zwei prototypen von irrigationnets  aus diesem grund bauen wir jetzt eine erste verkaufsfhige anlage in kaisersesch rheinlandpfalz bei einem solarkraftwerk auf pimp your plant die verdunstungskhlung von irrigationnets ist hoch effektiv und sehr kostengnstig und kann deswegen sehr gro skaliert werden dadurch knnen wir sehr groe mengen an kalter luft bereitstellen um solarkraftwerke zu khlen nun ist zwar bis zu  mehr stromertrag schon eine echte hausnummer aber die investoren sind harte rechner und erwarten noch grere renditen aus diesem grunde bieten wir die aufwertung von alten kraftwerken an denn bei einem alten solarkraftwerk mit alter einspeisevergtung ist jede kwh bis zu drei mal so viel wert wie bei heutigen projekten da die einspeisevergtungen extrem gesunken sind links khlanlagen incl eigenstromversorgung rechts altes solarkraftwerk mit hoher einspeisevergtung unter jedem giebel werden  quadratmeter verdunsternetze angebracht in denen ca  millionen mikrotropfen bei geringem windwiderstand in der luft hngen hier die planung und das bereits vorhandene material fr den ersten giebel giebel abmessungen und material die netze haben wir bereits vormontiert dadurch knnen die netze auf der baustelle dann in kurzer zeit an  aluminiumprofilen unter der alukonstruktion aufgehngt werden  die holzkonstruktion diente dabei nur als montagehilfe vormontage der netze  erste hlfte   m beginn der bauarbeiten fundamente fr die anlage von m  m  m weiterer baufortschritt nach verletzungsbedinger  wchiger pause  und das wetter fllt uns in den rcken wir hatten dort schon kurzrmlig gearbeitet aktuelles update vom  leider hatten nicht alle helfer zeit daher war kein weiterer aufbau mglich verstrkung der fundamente inzwischen bauen wir die erste verkaufsfhige version auf nur sind uns die kosten etwas explodiert fr die wetterbedingten hheren baukosten letzten technischen verbesserungen online berwachung und steuerung sowie zugehrige wissenschaftliche untersuchung und evaluation bentigen wir weitere  euro  ber das  zuschuss programm transferbonus knnen wir damit ein entwicklungsprojekt ber  euro finanzieren eine erste kleine anlage in marokko schlgt dann noch einmal mit weiteren  euro zu buche bei sehr groer untersttzung wird auch eine grere anlage in spanien fr weitere  euro mglich die anlage in spanien ersetzt dann schon einen kleinen regenwald zumindest was die khlung und befeuchtung der umgebenden steppe betrifft mit diesen referenzen sollten dann auch endlich kunden und weitere investoren gewonnen werden knnen das potential fr diese lsung liegt bei ber  solarkraftwerken im megawattbereich diese knnen an standorten auf einer kstenlinie von ber   km in ber  drregeplagten lndern stehen zudem finden sich im norden kenias der algerischen wste jordanien paraguay und chile sehr groe mengen an versalzenem grundwasser im landesinneren sobald sich diese technik durchsetzt werden diese wirtschaftlicheren solarkraftwerke nebenbei die umgebenden drregebiete renaturieren und drren bekmpfen und somit den klimawandel bremsen damit wir das leisten knnen brauchen wir jetzt bei der markteinfhrung eure untersttzung denn ohne referenzen im ausland gibt es keine kunden und keine verbreitung noch
